# Chapter 3: The Rebirth

## Fragment One: Drowning

Sensation without context.

Pressure. Everywhere. Crushing but not painful. Like being buried alive in warm sand.

Sound. A rhythmic thrumming. Distant. Mechanical. Too slow to be a heartbeat. Too regular to be natural.

No light. No air. No *self*.

Just existence. Floating. Formless.

Then: nothing.

---

## Fragment Two: The Scream

Awareness spiked like voltage through dead circuits.

*I'm awake I'm awake I'm AWAKE—*

Jon tried to scream. His throat didn't respond. No air passed his lips. Were his lips even there? He couldn't feel them. Couldn't feel anything except the warm, viscous pressure surrounding him.

Panic detonated in his chest—pure, chemical terror that had no outlet. He thrashed. At least, he thought he thrashed. His brain sent signals to his limbs, but the limbs were gone. Distant. Unresponsive.

*Paralyzed. The fall broke my back and now I'm paralyzed trapped in my own body oh God oh Christ please—*

Voices. Muffled. Coming from somewhere beyond the warm darkness.

"—neural spike—"

"—sedation protocol—"

"—not ready—"

Cold flooded his veins. The panic dulled, wrapped in chemical cotton. The darkness pulled him under.

And Jon sank, grateful.

---

## Fragment Three: The Memory

The fall.

Jon relived it in perfect, terrible clarity. Not a memory—a replay. His quantum-enhanced brain processing the trauma frame by frame.

The GHOST-7 rig sputtering. The ground rushing up. The asymmetric thrust spinning him. The impact.

The sensation of every bone shattering simultaneously. The taste of blood. The sound of his own body breaking.

And the thought, crystal-clear in that final microsecond:

*This is how I die.*

But he hadn't died.

*Why haven't I died?*

"—integration at 87%—"

"—another forty-eight hours—"

"—Kross wants him perfect—"

The voices again. Closer now. More distinct.

Jon tried to open his eyes. Failed. Tried to move his hand. Failed.

*Let me out. Please. Just let me OUT—*

The cold came again. Sedation. Forced unconsciousness.

But this time, Jon fought it.

For three eternal seconds, he fought the chemical tide pulling him under. His will against the drugs, his consciousness screaming against the darkness—

He lost.

The darkness swallowed him whole.

## Fragment Four: The Light

"Begin emergence sequence."

The voice was male. Calm. Familiar somehow, though Jon couldn't place it.

"Dr. Kross, are you certain? The protocol recommends—"

"I don't pay you to cite protocols. I pay you to follow orders. Begin emergence."

The warm pressure around Jon began to recede. He felt it draining away, leaving his skin cold and exposed.

Air touched him. Real air. Thin. Sharp. Wrong.

*Air means I'm not underwater. Not buried. Where am I?*

"Respiratory function nominal. Neural integration 94%. Musculoskeletal repair complete. Dr. Kross, Subject Six is viable."

"Subject Six." The male voice—Dr. Kross—sounded satisfied. "No. Not anymore. He's earned a name. He's Agent Six now."

Light stabbed through Jon's eyelids. Brilliant. Searing.

And for the first time in sixty-three days, Jon Rivian opened his eyes.

---

The world resolved slowly, in fragments:

A vaulted ceiling. White. Clinical. Studded with recessed LED panels.

Medical equipment. Sleek. Expensive. The kind he'd only seen in classified military hospitals.

A transparent tank. Amber gel draining away through vents. Residue coating the walls.

And standing beside the tank, looking down at Jon with an expression of profound satisfaction, was a man in a tailored suit.

"Welcome back, Specialist Rivian," Dr. Elias Kross said. "How do you feel?"

Jon's throat was raw. When he spoke, his voice came out as a rasp. "Where... what..."

"Take your time. You've been unconscious for quite a while."

Jon tried to sit up. His body responded instantly—too instantly. One moment he was lying down, the next he was upright, the movement so smooth it felt unnatural.

That's when he looked down at himself.

His body was naked, coated in residual amber gel. But it was his body. Same lean muscle. Same scars. Same—

No. Not the same.

His skin looked... different. In the harsh medical lighting, he could see faint patterns beneath the surface. Geometric. Hexagonal. Like circuitry etched into his flesh.

Jon raised his hand, turning it slowly. The patterns shifted under his skin, visible at certain angles, invisible at others. Like oil on water.

"What the fuck did you do to me?" His voice was stronger now. Edged with fear and rage.

Kross's smile never wavered. "I saved your life. You're welcome."

---

They gave Jon a gray jumpsuit. Led him through white corridors that all looked the same. Every door was biometrically locked. Every intersection monitored by cameras. Every surface sterile and cold.

Jon walked, but his mind was screaming.

The movement felt wrong. Too easy. Like his legs were hydraulics instead of bone and muscle. When he touched the wall to steady himself, his fingers left slight indentations in the metal.

*That's not possible. Metal doesn't dent from finger pressure.*

"We'll start with a basic orientation," Kross said, walking beside him like a tour guide. "Then move to—"

Jon stopped walking. "I want answers. Now. What is this place? How long have I been here? What did you do to my body?"

Kross turned, his expression patient. "All excellent questions. Come. I'll show you."

They entered an observation room overlooking what appeared to be a medical bay. Through the reinforced glass, Jon could see a row of emergence tanks identical to the one he'd woken in.

Three of them were occupied.

Jon approached the glass slowly, dread building in his gut.

The first tank held something that might have been human once. The body was swollen, distorted, covered in black lesions that looked like graphene plating erupting from the inside out. The face was barely recognizable. The eyes were open, unseeing.

Dead.

The second tank was worse. The occupant was thrashing—barely. Weak, jerking movements that suggested brain damage. The body was covered in the same graphene lesions, but these were spreading, consuming the flesh beneath.

Also dying.

The third tank held a woman. Asian features. Military bearing, even unconscious. Her body looked normal except for one arm—the entire limb was encased in black graphene, fused to the tank wall like she'd been trying to escape and solidified mid-attempt.

"Subjects Two, Three, and Four," Kross said clinically. "Creep-6 integration failures. Two and Three will be terminated once we've harvested what data we can. Four might be salvageable if we can stop the parasitic spread."

Jon stared at the bodies—at the *people*—dying in those tanks.

"You did this," he whispered. "You did this to them."

"I tried to save them. The technology wasn't perfected yet." Kross placed a hand on Jon's shoulder. Jon wanted to shrug it off but found himself frozen, staring at Subject Three's thrashing body. "But you, Specialist Rivian—you're different. The Creep-6 lattice bonded perfectly with your biology. You're what success looks like."

Jon turned slowly. "And if I'd been like them? If I'd... if I'd rejected the lattice?"

"Then you'd be in one of those tanks instead of standing here."

The casual cruelty of it hit Jon like a physical blow. He took a step back. Then another.

"I need to leave. I need to see my team. I need—"

"You need to calm down," Kross said, his voice firm. "Your heart rate is elevated. Adrenaline spiking. That's dangerous in your current state."

Jon felt it then. The hum. Low and thrumming, building in his bones like a generator spinning up.

"What is that?" Jon gasped.

"That's the lattice responding to stress. It's preparing your body for action. Fight or flight." Kross's eyes gleamed. "But you're not going to fight, Specialist. And you're not going to flee. Because you're smart enough to know you need answers first."

Jon's fists clenched. The hum intensified. He could feel power building in his muscles, could sense the lattice reinforcing his skeleton, could feel his perception sharpening to razor clarity.

He could kill Kross. Right now. Bare hands. It would be easy.

The thought terrified him.

"I... I need air. I need to think."

"Of course." Kross gestured to a guard Jon hadn't noticed. "Escort Specialist Rivian to Quarters Seven. Let him acclimate."

As they led him away, Jon looked back at the observation window. At the three people dying in their tanks. At the evidence of Kross's failures.

*I'm not a success,* Jon thought. *I'm just the one who survived long enough to be useful.*

---

The quarters were small. Spartan. A bed. A desk. A bathroom. No windows. A single door with a biometric lock.

Jon stood in the center of the room, trying to process.

He was alive. Somehow, impossibly, he was alive. The fall that should have killed him had... what? Led to this? To being rebuilt by a mad scientist using experimental nanotechnology?

*I need to leave. I need to get out of here.*

Jon moved to the door. It was sealed. He pulled at it experimentally.

The metal frame groaned.

Jon stared at his hand on the door handle. He wasn't pulling hard. Just a normal tug. But the reinforced steel frame was bending.

*What am I?*

He pulled harder. The door frame tore free from the wall with a shriek of tortured metal.

Alarms erupted. Red lights flashed.

Jon stepped through the destroyed doorway into the corridor beyond.

And found six guards waiting for him, weapons raised.

"Stand down, Specialist!" one of them shouted. "Return to your quarters immediately!"

Jon raised his hands. "I just want to leave. I don't want trouble. Just let me—"

The guard fired.

Not bullets. Some kind of taser round. It hit Jon in the chest, and 50,000 volts coursed through his body.

Jon staggered. The shock was intense, painful, but not incapacitating. The lattice was conducting the electricity, dispersing it, rendering it non-lethal.

He straightened, smoke rising from the burn mark on his jumpsuit.

The guards' expressions shifted from professional to afraid.

"Again!" the leader shouted.

All six fired at once.

The corridor lit up with electrical discharge. Jon felt every volt—felt his muscles seize, felt his nervous system scream in protest—but the lattice held. It conducted. It dispersed. It protected.

When the tasers cycled down, Jon was still standing.

"Enough."

Dr. Kross's voice, amplified through speakers.

"Specialist Rivian, you've made your point. You're stronger than normal humans. Faster. More resilient. Congratulations. Now return to your quarters, or I'll activate the control protocol."

Jon froze. "Control protocol?"

"Did you think we'd rebuild you without insurance? The Creep-6 lattice isn't just an enhancement, Specialist. It's also a leash. And I'm holding it."

Jon felt something shift in his mind. A presence. Waiting. Watching.

"You're bluffing," Jon said, but his voice was uncertain.

"Protocol: Subdue."

Jon's body moved without his permission.

His right arm bent behind his back. His left hand grabbed his right wrist, forcing it into a compliance hold. His legs folded, dropping him to his knees.

And Jon could only watch, horrified, as his own body obeyed commands that weren't his.

*No. No no no this isn't happening—*

"Protocol: Release."

Control returned in a rush. Jon gasped, stumbling forward, catching himself on his hands.

"Do you understand now?" Kross's voice was gentle. Almost kind. "You're not a prisoner, Specialist. You're an asset. A very valuable asset. We've invested $60 billion in your creation. Do you really think we'd let you just walk away?"

Jon looked up at the guards. At the cameras watching him. At the facility that was both his salvation and his cage.

"What do you want from me?" he whispered.

"Tomorrow, we'll discuss that in detail. Tonight, rest. Acclimate. Come to terms with what you are." A pause. "And Specialist? Don't try to escape again. Next time, I won't be so gentle with the protocol."

The guards lowered their weapons. One gestured back toward the destroyed door.

"Quarters, sir. Please."

Jon walked back into his room. Someone had already replaced the door frame. The new door slid shut behind him with a hydraulic hiss.

And Jon Rivian—veteran, soldier, hero—sat on the edge of his bed and stared at his hands.

Hands that could bend steel. Hands that could kill with casual ease. Hands that weren't entirely his anymore.

---

Hours passed. Jon sat in the dark, listening to the facility's ambient sounds. Ventilation systems. Distant machinery. The soft hum of his own enhanced nervous system.

At 0200 hours, the door opened.

Dr. Martinez stood in the threshold, looking exhausted. She held a data tablet.

"Thought you might want some answers," she said quietly. "The ones Kross won't give you."

Jon stood. "Come in."

She entered, the door sliding shut behind her. She handed him the tablet.

On the screen was a file: **MOSAIK: SUBJECTS 1-5**.

"What is this?" Jon asked.

"The people who came before you."

Jon scrolled through the file. Five names. Five faces. Five soldiers.

**Subject One: Captain Matteo Rask. EU Defense Force. Status: CRITICAL FAILURE. Location: Cryogenic Suspension, Level 4.**

The photo showed a man in his thirties. Strong features. Proud bearing. The kind of soldier Jon would have been honored to serve alongside.

The next photo—labeled "Current Status"—showed a nightmare. Matteo Rask's body had been consumed by black graphene plating. Nine feet tall. Barely human. Eyes glowing with bioluminescent corruption.

"Agent Zero," Martinez whispered. "The first attempt. Creep-1 was parasitic instead of symbiotic. It integrated, but it's eating him alive from the inside. His nervous system is in constant agony. He's kept sedated, frozen, because when he's conscious he's... violent."

Jon couldn't look away from the image.

*This could have been me.*

**Subject Two: Lieutenant Sarah Chen. US Marines. Status: DECEASED.**

**Subject Three: Sergeant David Okonkwo. British SAS. Status: DECEASED.**

**Subject Four: Specialist Yuki Tanaka. Japanese Self-Defense Forces. Status: DECEASED.**

**Subject Five: Corporal Anya Volkov. Russian Spetsnaz. Status: DECEASED.**

Four dead. One worse than dead. And Jon.

"Why are you showing me this?" Jon asked, his voice hoarse.

"Because Kross is going to tell you that you're special. That you're a success. A miracle." Martinez's eyes were haunted. "And you are. The Creep-6 lattice bonded with you perfectly. But Jon, you need to understand what it cost. These people—they trusted the program. They volunteered. And four of them died screaming."

She pulled up another file. Technical specifications. Schematics of the human nervous system overlaid with glowing lattice-work.

"The Creep-6 lattice isn't just a physical enhancement," she continued. "It's behavioral programming. It has subroutines designed to optimize your combat effectiveness by removing hesitation, fear, moral friction. It does this by making violence... pleasurable."

Jon felt cold. "What?"

"There's an itch. A pressure. It builds when you're inactive. The only way to relieve it is through physical action. Preferably violent action. The lattice rewards you chemically—dopamine, endorphins—when you fight, when you hurt, when you kill." Martinez looked at him with something like pity. "Kross turned you into an addict. And violence is your drug."

"No. I won't—"

"You will. Eventually. Because you won't have a choice. The itch will build until it's unbearable. And when you give in, when you satisfy it, it'll feel better than anything you've ever experienced. That's how Kross controls you. Not just with the protocol. With your own biology."

Jon wanted to argue. Wanted to insist he was stronger than some behavioral programming.

But he remembered the hum. The surge of power when he'd been angry. The feeling of bending steel with his bare hands.

It had felt good. God help him, it had felt amazing.

"Can it be removed?" he asked desperately.

Martinez shook her head. "The lattice is integrated at the molecular level. Removing it would mean removing you, cell by cell. You'd be dead in minutes."

Jon sat on the bed, his mind reeling. "So I'm trapped. A weapon that Kross can control remotely, programmed to crave violence, with no way out."

"Yes."

"Then why tell me? Why not just let me stay ignorant?"

Martinez looked at him for a long moment. "Because I helped design the Creep-6 lattice. I thought we were curing paralysis. Helping people walk again. Kross took my work and weaponized it. And now I have to watch people like you pay the price." Her voice cracked. "I can't stop him. But I can at least make sure you know what's been done to you. What you're becoming."

She moved toward the door, then stopped.

"Jon, the control protocol—it's embedded in your neural lattice. Kross can activate it any time you're within range of the facility's relay network. He can make you do anything. And there's only one way to sever it."

"How?"

"Root-level access to the MOSAIK Nexus. The central server. If you could upload an override code directly..." She shook her head. "But it's impossible. The Nexus is on Level Three, behind biometric locks and armed guards. You'd never make it."

"But theoretically, it could be done."

"Theoretically."

Martinez left, and Jon was alone again.

He sat in the darkness, staring at the tablet. At the faces of the dead. At the nightmare that was Agent Zero.

*Subject Six: Specialist Jon Rivian. Status: ACTIVE.*

Tomorrow, Kross would test him. Would push his new body to its limits. Would see if his $60 billion investment was worth it.

And Jon would perform. Because what choice did he have?

But as he sat there, feeling the lattice hum beneath his skin, feeling the first whispers of the itch Martinez had warned about, Jon made himself a promise.

*I'm still Jon Rivian. Still the soldier who brings everyone home. I won't let this thing turn me into a monster.*

*I won't.*

The lattice hummed in his bones, patient and waiting.

And somewhere deep in the facility, in a cryogenic tank on Level Four, Agent Zero dreamed nightmares of pain and rage.
