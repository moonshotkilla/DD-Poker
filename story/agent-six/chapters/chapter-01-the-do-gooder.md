# Chapter 1: The Do-Gooder

The shiver was the only warning you got.

It wasn't a sound. It was a pressure-drop in the inner ear, a vibration in the fillings of your teeth. It was the signature of ten thousand micro-drones—the "Razor Swarm"—adjusting their flight paths a kilometer away.

In the Warsaw Buffer Zone, silence was the enemy. The shiver was just its herald.

Specialist Jon "Jet" Rivian didn't move. He lay prone on the pulverized concrete of a bombed-out neo-brutalist government building, his breath a controlled, steady cloud of fog in his thermal-dampening mask. His rifle, a "smart-lock" kinetic, was slaved to his retinal display. The weapon's AI whispered constant updates into his inner ear: wind speed, barometric pressure, probability matrices for seventeen different threat vectors. It was like having a nervous accountant living in his skull.

He'd learned to ignore it. In the 15th year of the Pan-Asia European War, the human brain was the last analog device on the battlefield. Everything else was digital, networked, and compromised.

"Status, Rhino," Jon whispered, his voice a dry click over the local comms.

"Static-fuzz and fairy tales, Jet," came the reply. Sergeant First Class Marcus "Rhino" Okafor was hunkered down two floors below, his bulk somehow compressed into the skeletal remains of what used to be a records office. "PAC-Hack is running wild tonight. Comms are dirty, Aegis-Com is a ghost, and I'm pretty sure my optic just tried to sell me crypto."

Jon fought the urge to smile. Rhino had been his heavy gunner for three years, through six rotations in the Buffer Zones. The man was a walking contradiction: a 250-pound wall of muscle with a Masters in Classical Literature from Howard University. He quoted Virgil when he was scared and Wu-Tang when he was angry. Right now, his voice had the flat, sardonic tone that meant he was neither—just tired.

"Pops? You got the 'scope?"

"Got it," crackled the voice of their medic, Staff Sergeant Dennis "Pops" Michener. At forty-three, he was the oldest man in Delta Force, a medical prodigy who could've made a fortune in civilian practice but kept re-upping because, in his words, "someone has to keep you stupid bastards alive." "Tracking a PAC 'Iron-Hand' fire-team, three klicks east. Looks like they're... no. Wait. They're just a holographic projection." Pops sighed, the sound of a man who'd seen too much. "Dammit. I hate this war."

"It's a war, Pops. It's not supposed to be fun," Jon said, his eyes scanning the rubble-strewn landscape through his scope. The Warsaw Buffer Zone looked like God had taken an eraser to a city. Entire blocks were reduced to geometric abstractions of rebar and pulverized concrete. "We're here to find the hole in their net, not to like it. Aegis-Com says there's a hard-line data conduit under this sector. We find it, we plug in, we go home."

"And if Aegis-Com is wrong?" Pops asked.

"Aegis-Com is a five-hundred-trillion-dollar battle-AI," Rhino chimed in. "It's not wrong. It's just... creatively accurate."

"Both of you, stow it," Jon ordered, his tone shifting from 'buddy' back to 'Delta team-lead'. "Eyes up. That shiver is getting closer."

Jon Rivian was, by every metric that mattered to the United States Special Operations Command, the perfect soldier. At thirty-one, he'd racked up more decorations than men twice his age. Two Silver Stars. A Navy Cross. A collection of classified commendations that would never see the light of day. His file was flagged with the kind of annotations that made generals pay attention: "Exceptional tactical judgment." "Natural leader." "Recommended for advancement."

But the annotation that mattered most to the men in his unit was the one that would never appear in any official record: "He brings them home."

Jon was a "do-gooder" in a profession that had beaten the good out of most. He was the man who ran drills after the drills, the man who split his rations, the man who actually believed in the "bring 'em all home" bullshit they put on the recruitment posters. His callsign was "Jet" not just for his initials—fast, sharp, reliable—but because he was the fastest, sharpest, and most reliable man in the entire Delta program.

He'd earned that reputation six months ago in Krakow.

The memory surfaced unbidden, sharp-edged and unwelcome. A black-ops raid that had gone sideways. A building collapse. His team trapped in a sub-level with PAC forces closing in and a "Scorch" strike inbound. Command had written them off—three men, acceptable losses in the grand calculus of a war fought by algorithms. Jon had refused to accept it. He'd fought his way back in, pulled them out one by one, and carried the last man—a twenty-two-year-old from Ohio who'd been crying for his mother—through two klicks of hostile territory with a dislocated shoulder and a piece of shrapnel the size of a cigarette lighter embedded in his thigh.

The kid had lived. Jon's shoulder still clicked when it rained.

Command had given him a medal and a lecture about "acceptable risk parameters." His team had given him something more valuable: their absolute trust. In a war where your rifle could turn on you and your comms could be hijacked by an enemy AI you'd never see, trust was the only currency that mattered.

And he was about to spend all of it.

---

The shiver intensified. Jon's tactical display flickered, glitched, resolved into a nightmare.

"Contact," he said, his voice flat. "Razor Swarm, bearing zero-nine-zero, altitude two hundred meters, closing fast."

"How many?" Rhino asked.

Jon watched the swarm's signature bloom across his HUD like a malignant flower. "All of them."

A Razor Swarm wasn't a weapon system; it was a philosophy. Ten thousand micro-drones, each the size of a hummingbird, each armed with a shaped-charge warhead the size of a pill. Individually, they were laughable. Collectively, they could strip a city block down to the bedrock in under four minutes. They hunted using distributed AI—a hive mind that learned, adapted, and never forgot.

The PAC had unleashed them on civilian populations in the early years of the war. The videos were still used in training. They didn't show the explosions. They showed the aftermath: streets littered with bodies that looked like they'd been fed through an industrial sander.

"Orders, boss?" Rhino's voice was tight.

Jon's mind ran the probabilities. They were in a dead zone—no air support, no artillery, no quick-reaction force. Aegis-Com had sent them here precisely because it was a hole in the net, a place where human operators could move unseen. The flip side was that if something went wrong, they were ghosts. Unacknowledged. Expendable.

The swarm was forty seconds out.

"Bunker protocol," Jon said. "Seal your suits, kill all emissions, and pray they pass over."

It wasn't a plan. It was a hope. The Razor Swarm hunted using thermal, electromagnetic, and acoustic signatures. A fully sealed graphene-weave combat suit could mask most of those signatures for a while—maybe long enough for the swarm to find more interesting prey.

But Jon had been in this war long enough to know that hope was a luxury the Buffer Zones couldn't afford.

The shiver stopped.

"Oh, shit," Rhino said.

The silence that followed was heavy, absolute, pregnant with implication. Jon's HUD painted the swarm as a crimson cloud, hovering, searching. His heart was a metronome in his chest. He could hear his own breathing inside the sealed helmet, each exhale a muted roar.

Then: a new sound.

Not the insectile buzz of the drones. Something else. Something worse.

A high-pitched, directional whine, like a dentist's drill the size of a bus.

Jon's blood went cold. He knew that sound. Every operator in the Buffer Zones knew that sound. It was the shriek of a hypersonic "Blade" missile in its terminal phase, a nine-foot spear of tungsten and ceramic traveling at Mach 7, guided by an AI that could predict where you'd run before you knew yourself.

"Blade!" Jon screamed, but it was too late.

The missile struck the central support pillar of their building at exactly 19:34:17 local time. The building's AI, a stripped-down civilian model that had been trying to keep the structure stable for the past eight years, had 0.003 seconds to register the impact before its processors were vaporized.

The world dissolved.

Jon's universe became a maelstrom of noise, pain, and falling concrete. His graphene-weave armor locked rigid—a safety protocol designed to keep his spine intact—but the impact sent him tumbling down a two-story void like a pinball in a machine built by a sadist. He hit a steel beam, bounced, struck a wall, and finally landed hard on a pile of rubble that had been a reception desk in some forgotten corporate past.

The wind was knocked from him. His HUD was a screaming symphony of red-line warnings:

**ARMOR INTEGRITY: 74%**
**BIOMONITOR: STABLE**
**LOCAL COMMS: OFFLINE**
**WARNING: STRUCTURAL COLLAPSE IMMINENT**

"Rhino! Pops! Status!" he yelled, his voice raw. He slammed the side of his helmet, trying to reset the comm system. "Rhino! Pops!"

Static.

Then: "Here... Jet," Rhino's voice sputtered back, filled with static and the sound of shifting rubble. "Got the wind knocked out of me. I'm... I'm good. Floor three. Can't see Pops."

"Pops! Talk to me!" Jon was already moving, his body operating on pure training, ignoring the stabbing pain in his ribs that meant he'd cracked at least two of them.

Silence. Then, a groan. A pained, wet sound that made Jon's stomach clench.

"Jet... ah, hell, Jet. I'm pinned."

Jon was on his feet in an instant, his HUD's mapping system struggling to process the new, chaotic architecture of the collapsed building. Pops was two floors down, in what used to be the lobby. "Pinned how, Pops? Talk to me."

"Rebar," Pops gasped. There was a liquid quality to his voice that Jon didn't like. "It's... it's through my side. Missed the plate by two inches. I'm... I'm leaking, boss. I can feel it. It's bad."

Jon's HUD flashed. A new voice, cold, synthesized, and perfectly calm, overrode their squad channel. It was Aegis-Com, the battle-AI that controlled the entire US-NATO operational theater, speaking with the authority of God filtered through a text-to-speech algorithm.

**[Aegis-Com: DELTA-THREE, ASSET 'POPS' IS COMPROMISED. BIOMETRICS ARE RED-LINE. BLOOD PRESSURE DROPPING. ASSET IS CONSIDERED UNRECOVERABLE. RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE EGRESS.]**

"Aegis-Com, this is Jet," Jon snapped, already running, leaping over a chasm where a staircase used to be. His augmented muscles screamed in protest, but he ignored them. "Negative! I am moving to recover!"

**[Aegis-Com: Negative, Specialist Rivian. Tactical situation has deteriorated. A PAC armor column has diverted to your position. High probability they detected the Blade impact and are moving to exploit. Proximity: four minutes. We are executing Protocol: Scorch. This structure is now designated Target Priority Alpha.]**

A new timer appeared in the corner of Jon's HUD, red numerals counting down with mechanical inevitability.

**TIME TO IMPACT: 03:00**

"What? A 'Scorch' strike? On us?" Rhino screamed over the comm, his voice cracking. "They're gonna level the whole fucking block!"

Protocol: Scorch. A full-yield thermobaric strike package. Two missiles, each carrying a fuel-air explosive capable of generating a blast wave that would incinerate everything within a three-hundred-meter radius. It didn't just kill people; it erased them. Turned bone to ash and ash to vapor.

The PAC column was four minutes away. The Scorch strike was three minutes away.

The math was simple. Aegis-Com was trading three American lives for a confirmed kill on a dozen PAC assets. In the grand calculus of the war, it was a good trade.

Jon didn't give a damn about the calculus.

"Rhino," Jon said, his voice dropping to a dangerous calm as he landed on the lobby floor. He could see Pops now, twenty yards away, a dark shape impaled on a thick spike of rebar like a butterfly pinned to a collector's board. "You egress to the evac point. That's an order."

"Jon, no," Rhino said, and there was something in his voice Jon had never heard before: fear. Not of the enemy. Fear for him. "You heard the AI. Three minutes! He's gone, brother. We gotta go!"

**[Aegis-Com: Acknowledge the order, Specialist Rivian. Egress immediately. This is a direct command.]**

Jon looked at the timer. **02:45.** He looked at Pops, who was trying, weakly, to unclip his own helmet with shaking hands.

"Go, Jon," Pops whispered, his voice catching. Blood was pooling beneath him, black in the dim light. "Don't... don't be a fool. Get Rhino out. That's an order, boss."

Jon had a choice. He could follow orders, follow the math, follow the cold logic of a war fought by machines that didn't bleed. He could save himself and Rhino and let Pops die alone in the dark.

Or he could do what he always did: the right thing, no matter the cost.

He muted his comm to Aegis-Com. He looked at Rhino, a shadow on the floor above. "I said go, Rhino! Egress! I'm getting my man!"

"You're a crazy bastard, Jet!" Rhino shouted, but his shadow disappeared. He was obeying.

Jon sprinted to Pops. Up close, it was worse than he'd thought. The rebar was thick, jagged, rust-red. It had punched through the gap in Pops's armor at the lower-right quadrant, just above the pelvis. The "Scorch" strike wasn't a Blade. It was a full-yield thermobaric package. It wouldn't just kill them; it would erase them. Turn them into superheated plasma and scatter their atoms across three city blocks.

**01:30**

"Can't... can't pull it out, Jet," Pops slurred, his face pale beneath his visor. "Femoral artery. I pull it out, I'm dead in ninety seconds. Leave it in, same problem." He laughed, a wet, bubbling sound. "Funny, right? Either way, I'm fucked."

"Shut up," Jon said. He didn't try to pull the rebar out. He knew Pops was right. Instead, he braced his boot against the concrete slab that held the rebar's base. He didn't have time for finesse. He bent the rebar, using every ounce of his augmented strength, the graphene-weave in his suit whining in protest, the servos in his exoskeletal frame screaming. The rebar groaned, a sound like a dying animal, then snapped.

Pops screamed.

**00:45**

"No time to be gentle, brother." Jon hefted Pops—all 220 pounds of man and gear—onto his shoulder in a fireman's carry. Pops groaned, teetering on the edge of consciousness. Blood was streaming down Jon's armor, hot and slick.

Jon ran. He was a freight train of muscle and armor, his legs pumping, his lungs burning, his HUD painting the optimal egress route as a glowing green line through the chaos.

**00:30**

He could see the blown-out western wall of the lobby. Beyond it, the rubble-strewn street. The evac point was 300 meters away. He could make it. He had to make it.

**00:15**

He could hear it now. Not a shiver. Not a whine. A scream. The sound of the sky being torn in half. The sound of two thermobaric missiles descending at terminal velocity, their guidance systems locked on the building's GPS coordinates with a precision that would have been beautiful if it weren't so terrible.

**00:05**

"Gonna be close!" he yelled to no one, his voice lost in the roar.

**00:02**

He didn't run out. He dove. He tucked his body around Pops, a human shield, and launched himself through the air, out of the building and into the street beyond.

**00:00**

He was mid-air when the "Scorch" missiles hit.

---

The world turned white-hot.

There was no sound. Sound required air, and for a brief, eternal moment, there was no air. The thermobaric explosions consumed every molecule of oxygen in a three-hundred-meter radius, replacing it with a superheated pressure wave traveling at 3,000 meters per second.

Jon was hit by a fist of pure, burning-hot pressure. It slammed into his back, lifting him, accelerating him, throwing him like a toy in the hands of an angry god. His armor screamed in protest, every warning light flashing **CRITICAL** before his HUD died completely, overwhelmed by the electromagnetic pulse of the blast.

He was aware, distantly, of tumbling through the air. Of Pops's body still clutched in his arms. Of the ground rushing up.

Then: impact.

He landed in a heap of shattered asphalt and twisted metal, his body on top of Pops. The graphene-weave armor had saved them—barely. He could feel the heat radiating from the plates, could smell the acrid stench of vaporized composite materials.

Then: blackness.

---

He woke to the smell of ozone and the feeling of hands on his helmet.

"...crazy bastard... I can't believe... he's alive... Jet! Jet, wake up, you stupid son of a bitch..."

Jon's eyes fluttered open. Rhino was staring down at him, his face a mask of awe and terror. Behind him, the building was gone—replaced by a crater filled with dancing flames. The sky was the color of old bruises.

"You're a crazy bastard, Jet," Rhino said, his voice thick.

Jon coughed, a cloud of pulverized concrete dust billowing from his mask. He looked down. Pops was still cradled in his arms, groaning, but alive. His bio-monitor showed red across the board, but the numbers were stable. Stable meant salvageable.

"Get him," Jon rasped, his throat raw. "Get him... to the bird."

As Rhino and another specialist—where had they come from?—hauled Pops away toward the extraction Osprey that was settling onto the rubble like a prehistoric bird, Jon's HUD flickered, then rebooted in low-power mode. Most of the display was black, dead pixels and fried circuits. But in the center, a single message blinked, red and insistent, waiting for him like a bill collector at the door.

**[FROM: AEGIS-COM]**
**[SUBJECT: URGENT]**
**[Disobedience of Direct Order. Protocol: Scorch.]**
**[REPORT TO DEBRIEFING. IMMEDIATE.]**
**[NOTE: Specialist Rivian, your actions resulted in the survival of Asset 'Pops' and did not compromise mission objectives. However, failure to comply with AI-directed tactical commands is a violation of Article 92 of the UCMJ. Disciplinary action pending review.]**

Jon Rivian spat a bloody-pink slurry of dust onto the ground. His ribs were on fire. His back felt like it had been hit by a truck. His armor was a ruined mess.

But Pops was alive. Rhino was alive. He was alive.

He had saved his man.

He was a hero.

And he was in more trouble than he'd ever been in his life.

As the Osprey lifted off, banking hard to avoid a fresh wave of PAC interceptors, Jon looked down at his hands. They were shaking. Not from fear. From something else. Something he couldn't quite name.

It felt like pride. And it felt like the beginning of the end.

**End of Chapter 1**
