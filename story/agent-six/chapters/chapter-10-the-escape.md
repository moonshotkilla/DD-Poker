# Chapter 10: The Escape

The Nexus level was a war zone.

Shattered server racks leaked coolant and sparked with electrical fires. Emergency lighting cast everything in hellish red. Alarms wailed a discordant symphony of violated security protocols. And scattered across the floor were unconscious guards and Stalkers—thirty-seven men and women who'd tried to stop one superhuman weapon and failed.

Jon stood at the center of it all, breathing hard, the data spike clutched in his hand.

The control protocol was gone. Severed. He could feel the absence where Kross's leash had been, like phantom pain for a limb that had been amputated.

He was free.

But as he stood there, feeling the itch already starting to rebuild—hungry, demanding, never satisfied—Jon understood that freedom was more complicated than he'd imagined.

"Jan!" Mira's voice crackled through his earpiece, urgent and afraid. "I'm reading massive security response. Twenty more guards converging on your position. You need to extract. NOW."

Jon looked at the carnage around him. Looked at his hands, bloodied but already healing. Looked at the terminal where he'd plugged in Rostova's code.

*Mission accomplished,* he thought. *So why does it feel unfinished?*

"Jon, talk to me!"

"I'm here," he said. "Coming out."

"Can you make it back through the geothermal tunnel?"

Jon's enhanced hearing picked up sounds from multiple directions—boots on metal stairs, weapons being charged, the mechanical whir of automated defense systems activating.

"No. Tunnel's compromised. I'm going out the front door."

"The front—Jon, that's suicide! The main entrance is—"

"The fastest way out." Jon started moving, leaving the Nexus behind. "Trust me."

---

The facility had transformed from a secure research installation into an active combat zone. Every corridor Jon entered was filled with guards, every stairwell a potential ambush point.

He didn't try to hide. Didn't try to sneak.

He just ran.

The guards had the same problem every opponent he'd faced since Amsterdam: they were too slow. Their enhanced reflexes and military training meant nothing against someone who could process time at quantum speeds.

Jon moved through them like wind through leaves—there, then gone, then there again. A guard would raise his weapon, and Jon would be past him before the trigger could be pulled. A security door would slam shut, and Jon would tear it from its hinges.

He was a force of nature wearing human skin.

Level Three became Level Two. Medical and residential sectors flashed past. Jon caught glimpses of scientists in lab coats fleeing, medical staff huddling in doorways, regular facility workers who'd never expected to see the project they worked on turned loose inside their own building.

Civilians.

The itch pulsed, whispering that they were all complicit, all part of MOSAIK, all fair game.

Jon ignored it. He had a mission. Get out. Regroup with Mira. Figure out what came next.

*What does come next?* the cold voice asked. *You're free from Kross. But you're still a weapon. Still addicted. Still becoming what he wanted.*

Level Two became Level One.

And that's when the facility's automated defenses activated.

---

Jon heard them before he saw them—the high-pitched whine of servos, the pneumatic hiss of hydraulics.

Security turrets dropped from ceiling panels, their barrels tracking with inhuman precision. Not regular weapons. Something else.

**THOOM. THOOM. THOOM.**

The turrets fired—not bullets but high-velocity projectiles the size of beer cans. They hit the corridor walls and exploded, not with fire but with foam. Riot-suppression rounds designed to immobilize targets without killing them.

Jon dodged the first volley, his quantum brain tracking trajectories. But the turrets were networked, their AI learning from each miss, adjusting firing patterns.

The second volley was harder to dodge. One projectile clipped his shoulder, exploded, and suddenly his left arm was encased in rapidly-hardening foam.

Jon tore the foam off with his right hand, the lattice-reinforced muscles making it trivial. But more turrets were deploying, more foam rounds filling the air.

They were trying to slow him down, pin him, hold him until the kill teams arrived.

Jon looked at the ceiling, calculated angles, and jumped.

His enhanced strength launched him twelve feet vertically. He grabbed a ceiling support beam, swung, and kicked through a wall panel into the maintenance space above the corridor.

The turrets tracked him but couldn't get a firing angle. Jon crawled through the narrow space, his enhanced senses guiding him toward the main entrance.

Behind him, he heard orders being shouted, more security teams being deployed. The facility was throwing everything it had at him.

Not to kill him. To capture him.

Kross wanted his investment back.

*Good luck with that,* Jon thought grimly.

---

He emerged from the maintenance crawlspace into the facility's main atrium—a three-story space designed to impress visitors with MOSAIK's technological sophistication. Holographic displays showed corporate logos. Sleek furniture sat in conversational clusters. Everything was chrome and glass and expensive.

And standing in the center of the atrium, waiting for him, was Dr. Elias Kross.

He wasn't alone. Twenty guards surrounded him in a defensive perimeter—the facility's last line of defense. But they weren't aiming their weapons at Jon.

They were aimed at Kross.

*Hostage situation,* Jon's tactical brain analyzed. *Kross is bait. The guards have orders to defend him but not engage unless I move on him.*

Kross looked exactly as Jon remembered—tailored suit, aristocratic features, that expression of supreme confidence that came from being the smartest person in every room he entered.

"Agent Six," Kross said, his voice amplified by the atrium's acoustics. "Congratulations. You successfully infiltrated a maximum-security facility, fought off enhanced operators, disabled my best asset, and severed your control protocol. Quite an achievement."

Jon stopped fifty feet from Kross, his body coiled and ready. "Get out of my way."

"I'd rather not. We need to talk."

"We're done talking."

"Are we?" Kross gestured at the guards surrounding him. "You could kill me right now. Kill all of them. Your abilities make it trivial. But you won't. Do you know why?"

Jon's jaw clenched. The itch was purring, interested in the challenge.

"Because you're still trying to be the hero," Kross continued. "Still clinging to the idea that you're Jon Rivian, the do-gooder who brings everyone home. You maintain your little moral code—no killing—because that's the last thread connecting you to who you used to be."

"I'm leaving," Jon said. "Don't try to stop me."

"I'm not trying to stop you. I'm trying to save you."

That made Jon pause. "Save me?"

"From yourself." Kross took a step forward, and the guards shifted nervously. "Agent Six, you severed the control protocol. Congratulations. You're autonomous now. Free. But freedom is a double-edged sword, isn't it? Because now you're alone with the itch. Alone with the craving. And every day, that craving will get stronger."

Jon said nothing.

"The control protocol wasn't just a leash," Kross said. "It was a safety measure. A way to manage your condition, to channel your violent impulses in productive directions. Without it, you're going to lose yourself. Slowly. Inevitably. You'll become exactly what I designed you to be—a perfect weapon—but with no guidance, no purpose, no handler to aim you at worthy targets."

"I'll aim myself," Jon said.

"At who? Criminals? Terrorists? Bad guys?" Kross smiled sadly. "How long before that's not enough? How long before the itch demands more, and your definition of 'fair game' expands to include anyone who gets in your way?"

The words hit close to home. Too close.

"Come back to MOSAIK," Kross said. "Not as a puppet. As a partner. We'll remove the behavioral subroutines, fix the addiction, make you truly human again. All I ask in return is that you serve. Use your gifts for the purpose they were intended—protecting American interests, eliminating threats, saving lives."

*Think of all the lives I can save,* Jon thought bitterly. The phrase that had once motivated him now sounded like a cruel joke.

"You made me a monster," Jon said quietly. "And now you want me to work for you?"

"I made you a god," Kross corrected. "What you choose to do with that divinity is up to you. But Agent Six, understand this: if you walk out that door, you're not just a rogue asset. You're a loose weapon. Every intelligence agency on the planet will hunt you. You'll spend whatever remains of your life running, hiding, and eventually killing. Because the itch will win. It always wins."

Jon looked at the guards. At Kross. At the facility that had rebuilt him.

And he made his choice.

"Then I'll run," he said. "And when they come for me, I'll fight. And maybe the itch will win. But at least it'll be my choice."

He turned toward the main entrance.

"Agent Six, wait—"

Jon didn't wait. He sprinted toward the blast-resistant doors that sealed the facility's main entrance.

The guards opened fire.

Foam rounds, rubber bullets, stun weapons—everything designed to immobilize without killing. They hit Jon from all directions, but his lattice-hardened skin made them irrelevant. The impacts barely slowed him.

He hit the blast doors at full speed.

The doors were designed to withstand military-grade explosives. They weighed six tons each. They were sealed by electromagnetic locks that required three separate authorization codes to open.

Jon's lattice-enhanced body generated 30,000 pounds of kinetic force.

The doors didn't just open. They exploded outward, torn from their reinforced frames, and tumbled across the parking lot beyond like discarded toys.

Jon walked through the opening into the Nevada night.

Behind him, alarms wailed. Kross was shouting orders. Guards were regrouping.

But Jon was already gone, disappearing into the desert darkness faster than any pursuit could follow.

---

The rendezvous point was a rock formation thirty miles from the facility, chosen because it offered good visibility and multiple egress routes.

Mira was there, pacing next to the rented SUV, her face tight with worry. When Jon emerged from the darkness, running at speeds that would have shattered a normal human's legs, she nearly collapsed with relief.

"Oh thank God," she breathed. "I heard the alarms, saw the security chatter. I thought—"

"I'm fine," Jon said. He was covered in dust, his clothes torn, his body vibrating with residual adrenaline. "It's done. The control protocol is severed."

"Did you get out clean?"

Jon thought about the thirty-seven people he'd incapacitated. The walls he'd torn through. The doors he'd destroyed. The conversation with Kross.

"Clean enough."

Mira studied his face in the moonlight. Whatever she saw there made her expression shift from relief to concern. "Jon... how are you feeling?"

"Like I said. Fine."

"Your hands are shaking."

Jon looked down. She was right. His hands were trembling, clenching and unclenching involuntarily. The itch was already building again, less than an hour after the Nexus fight.

It had never returned this fast before.

"It's just adrenaline," Jon lied.

"No, it's not." Mira stepped closer, her voice dropping. "I heard you during the infiltration. On the comm. The way you sounded when you were fighting those Stalkers. You were... you were enjoying it."

"They were enhanced operators. The fight was challenging. Is it a crime to appreciate a challenge?"

"It is when you laugh like that." Mira's eyes were full of worry and something else. Fear? "Jon, you sounded like someone else. Not the soldier I met in Amsterdam. Someone colder. Hungrier."

Jon wanted to argue, wanted to insist he was still in control. But he remembered the laugh. The pure, unbridled joy he'd felt dismantling those Stalkers.

"The control protocol is gone," he said quietly. "That's what we came here to do. Mission accomplished."

"But the itch is still there."

"Yes."

"And it's getting worse."

"Yes."

Mira wrapped her arms around herself, suddenly looking very small and very afraid. "What are we going to do, Jon?"

*We.* As if this was still a team effort. As if Mira was still his partner and not just a civilian he was protecting.

But Jon had spent the last thirty miles thinking about exactly this question. Thinking about what came next. And he'd reached a conclusion he didn't like but couldn't avoid.

"You're going home," Jon said.

"What?"

"You're going back to Prague, or wherever you want to go. I'll give you enough money to disappear, to start over. Rostova will help you establish a new identity. But you're done with this."

"Jon, I'm not leaving you—"

"Yes, you are." His voice was harder than he intended. "Mira, I cut the leash. But Kross was right about one thing—I'm a loose weapon now. Every intelligence agency that funded MOSAIK is going to hunt me. And anyone with me becomes a target."

"Then we fight them together—"

"No." Jon grabbed her shoulders, forced her to look at him. "Listen to me. You're not enhanced. You're not a weapon. You're a civilian who got caught up in this because Kross tried to have you killed. But you're not a soldier, Mira. And where I'm going, soldiers die."

"Where are you going?"

Jon released her, stepped back. The itch was a dull roar now, demanding release, demanding action.

"I'm going hunting," he said simply.

Mira's face went pale. "Jon... what does that mean?"

"It means I can't run forever. It means the itch isn't going to get better, it's going to get worse. It means I need to aim it at targets that deserve it." He looked at his shaking hands. "Kross funded this project with black budget money from a dozen agencies. There are people out there—politicians, generals, corporate executives—who signed off on turning soldiers into weapons. Who knew about the behavioral programming, the control protocols, the failed subjects. They're complicit."

"You're talking about assassination."

"I'm talking about justice."

"You're talking about becoming exactly what Kross wanted!"

Jon's jaw clenched. "Maybe. But at least I'll be choosing my targets. At least I'll have a code."

"A code." Mira laughed, a brittle sound. "You mean like Dexter? Kill the bad guys and pretend that makes you a hero?"

"It's better than becoming a mindless killer."

"Is it?" Mira's voice rose. "Jon, listen to yourself! You're rationalizing! You're building a framework that lets you justify violence, and every time you use it, that framework gets easier to abuse. First it's war criminals and black-ops directors. Then it's guards at data centers. Then it's anyone who works for the wrong company, who's in the wrong place, who looks at you the wrong way—"

"I'm not going to—"

"You already did!" Mira shouted. "In Dresden! You almost strangled that security guard to death! And the only reason you didn't was because I stopped you!"

The words hung in the air between them.

Jon wanted to argue. Wanted to insist she was wrong.

But she wasn't.

"That's why you need to leave," Jon said quietly. "Because next time, you might not be able to stop me. And I won't let you get hurt because of what I'm becoming."

Mira's eyes filled with tears. "I don't want to lose you."

"You already lost me. I died in that HALO jump. What came back is something else."

"No." Mira stepped closer, put a hand on his chest, over his heart. "You're still in there, Jon. I can feel it. The man who saved me in Amsterdam. The soldier who wouldn't kill those Stalkers even when his body was screaming for it. You're still fighting."

"For how long?" Jon asked. "How long before the fight costs more than it's worth?"

Mira didn't have an answer.

They stood in the Nevada desert, two people who'd survived impossible odds, and for a moment neither of them spoke.

Finally, Jon broke the silence. "There's something I need to do. Before I disappear. Before I become whatever I'm becoming."

"What?"

"Kross is still in that facility. Still running MOSAIK. Still turning soldiers into weapons." Jon looked back toward the distant lights of the installation. "As long as he's alive, there will be more subjects. More failures. More people like Agent Zero, trapped in agony. I need to end this. Permanently."

"You're going back," Mira said, realization dawning.

"Yes."

"Jon, you'll never make it. You barely got out the first time. They'll be ready for you now. They'll have—"

"Agent Zero," Jon finished. "I know. That's why I need to do it now, before they have time to prepare. Hit them while they're reeling."

"This is suicide."

"Maybe. But it's the right thing to do." Jon met her eyes. "For once in all of this, I know exactly what I'm supposed to do. Not because the itch is telling me, not because I'm rationalizing—because it's actually right. Kross needs to be stopped. MOSAIK needs to be destroyed. And I'm the only one who can do it."

Mira stared at him for a long moment. Then she pulled out her laptop from the SUV, opened it, and began typing rapidly.

"What are you doing?" Jon asked.

"Getting you intel." Her fingers flew across the keyboard. "If you're going back, you're going prepared. Rostova, are you still on the line?"

A crackle, then Rostova's voice. "I'm here. I've been listening. Agent Six, this is insane."

"Probably," Jon agreed.

"Kross will have activated every contingency. Zero will be hunting you. The facility will be locked down. You'll be walking into a deathtrap."

"I know."

Rostova was silent for a moment. Then: "Mira, send him the blueprints. All of them. Every level, every access point, every system. If he's going to do this, we make sure he has every advantage."

"Thank you," Jon said.

"Don't thank me yet. You're probably going to die." Rostova's voice was clinical, but there was an edge of something else. Respect? "But if you do manage to kill Kross, if you destroy MOSAIK—it'll be worth it. That bastard deserves everything you're going to do to him."

Mira uploaded files to a secure drive, handed it to Jon. "Complete facility architecture. Security protocols. Personnel roster. Everything we stole from Dresden plus everything Rostova kept from her time there."

Jon took the drive. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me." Mira's voice cracked. "Just... just come back, okay? Even if you're different. Even if you're not the Jon I met. Just survive."

Jon wanted to promise he would. Wanted to tell her everything would be okay.

But he'd made enough promises he couldn't keep.

Instead, he pulled her into a brief, tight hug. She was warm and solid and human, a reminder of what he'd been before Kross had turned him into this.

Then he released her, stepped back, and started walking toward the SUV.

"Where are you going?" Mira asked.

"To get more gear. Then I'm going back to finish this."

"Jon—"

He turned back one last time. "If I don't make it out, tell Rostova to release everything. All the MOSAIK files, all the research, all of Kross's crimes. Make sure the world knows what they did."

"And if you do make it out?"

Jon looked at his hands, at the faint hexagonal patterns of the lattice beneath his skin.

"Then I guess we'll find out what kind of monster I've become."

He drove away into the pre-dawn darkness, leaving Mira alone in the desert.

---

Jon drove to a 24-hour big-box store in Tonopah, forty miles from the facility. It was 0500 hours, and the store was nearly empty except for a few night-shift workers and insomniacs.

He bought supplies. Everything he'd need for an assault on a hardened military facility: rope, cutting tools, first-aid supplies, high-calorie food to fuel his enhanced metabolism. Everything civilian and legal, but repurposed for war.

As he loaded the supplies into the SUV, the itch pulsed again, stronger now.

*Four hours since the Nexus fight. Twelve hours until it becomes unbearable. Twenty-four hours until you lose control.*

He had a window. Narrow, but enough.

Jon pulled out the secure drive Mira had given him, loaded it onto a tablet he'd bought. The facility blueprints appeared, three-dimensional and detailed.

He'd entered through the geothermal tunnel, fought his way to the Nexus, and exited through the main entrance. He knew the facility's layout now, understood its security patterns.

Going back would be harder. They'd be expecting him. Zero would be waiting. Kross would have every advantage.

But Jon had one advantage they didn't know about: he was no longer afraid of dying.

A man with nothing to lose was the most dangerous weapon of all.

He studied the blueprints for an hour, his quantum brain processing routes, contingencies, assault vectors. By the time the sun rose over the Nevada desert, he had a plan.

It was risky. Brutal. With a high probability of failure.

But it would work.

*If you survive,* the cold voice whispered.

Jon looked at his reflection in the SUV's side mirror. His face was the same—same features, same eyes. But there was something different in the expression. Something harder. Hungrier.

He barely recognized himself.

*Good,* the voice said. *Because the man you used to be couldn't do what needs to be done. But you can. You're strong enough. Fast enough. Ruthless enough.*

*Am I though?* Jon asked himself. *When I face Kross, when I have him at my mercy—will I cross that last line?*

*You'll find out soon enough.*

Jon drove back toward the MOSAIK facility, the morning sun at his back, his hands steady on the wheel.

The itch was purring now, anticipating.

Not with dread.

With excitement.

And that, more than anything, told Jon exactly what he was becoming.

---

The facility looked the same from the outside—unremarkable industrial buildings in the middle of the Nevada desert, the kind of place that appeared on no maps and generated no curiosity.

But Jon could see the changes. Additional guards patrolling the perimeter. Automated turrets that had been deployed overnight. The main entrance he'd destroyed was being repaired by a construction crew working at frantic speed.

They knew he was coming back.

Good.

Jon parked the SUV five miles from the facility, in a wash that would hide it from aerial surveillance. He gathered his gear—minimal, because he didn't need much—and started walking.

The desert was already hot, the sun beating down mercilessly. A normal human would have struggled in this heat. Jon's enhanced metabolism regulated his temperature effortlessly.

He reached the facility's perimeter at 1100 hours.

And that's when he heard it.

A roar. Distant but unmistakable. The sound of rage and pain and something that might have been a battle cry.

Agent Zero.

He was out there. Hunting. Waiting.

Jon felt the itch surge, not with fear but with anticipation.

*Finally. A worthy opponent. A real fight.*

He smiled.

And walked toward the sound.
