# Chapter 6: The Quench

The safe house was a shithole.

Jon had seen worse—forward operating bases in the Buffer Zones had been little more than sandbags and hope—but this place ran a close second. It was a condemned apartment building in the Bijlmermeer district of Amsterdam, scheduled for demolition but caught in bureaucratic limbo. Squatters had lived here once; now it was just empty concrete and the ghosts of better times.

Mira sat on a broken chair in what used to be a living room, her laptop balanced on her knees, running off a battery pack she'd bought at a 24-hour electronics shop. She'd been typing for three hours straight, her fingers flying across the keys with the kind of focused intensity that spoke of desperation.

Jon stood at the window, watching the street below. Dawn was breaking over Amsterdam, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink that seemed obscene given the circumstances.

They'd been running for eighteen hours.

After the encounter with Agent Zero, they'd moved through the city like ghosts, avoiding cameras, staying off the grid, using cash Mira had stashed in various dead-drops around the city. She'd been planning her escape for weeks, she'd told him. She'd known MOSAIK would eventually find her.

She just hadn't expected them to send a superhuman assassin.

"How long until they find us?" Jon asked, not turning from the window.

"Hard to say. I've been spoofing our digital signatures, bouncing fake GPS pings all over Europe. With any luck, they think we're in Prague right now." Mira rubbed her eyes. She looked exhausted. "But luck doesn't last long against MOSAIK's surveillance net. Six hours, maybe twelve if we're incredibly fortunate."

Jon nodded. The itch was back. It had started about an hour ago, a faint crawling under his skin that was rapidly becoming impossible to ignore. His hands were restless, clenching and unclenching. His mind kept running tactical scenarios—escape routes, ambush points, kill boxes.

"You okay?" Mira asked, looking up from her laptop.

"Fine."

"You don't look fine. You look like you're about to jump out of your skin."

Jon forced himself to be still. "It's the itch. The lattice wants... activity."

"Activity meaning violence."

"Yes."

Mira closed her laptop. "How bad is it?"

"Manageable." It wasn't. The itch was worse than before—sharper, more insistent. It felt like his cells were vibrating at the wrong frequency, like his entire body was out of tune and only action could correct it.

"There's a subroutine in the Creep-6 code," Mira said. "I designed it to maintain optimal readiness in military contexts. The idea was that the lattice would keep a soldier's nervous system primed for combat, reducing reaction times during sustained operations." She looked guilty. "I didn't realize Kross would weaponize it. Turn it into a... a craving."

"Can you disable it?"

"Not remotely. It's hardcoded into your neural lattice. The only way to remove it is through the Nexus upload." She paused. "Jon, the itch is only going to get worse. The lattice is designed to build pressure until it's released through physical exertion. Preferably violent physical exertion."

"How do I manage it?"

"You don't. You satisfy it." Mira stood, walked to her backpack, pulled out a printout—data she'd compiled from her stolen MOSAIK files. "Subject One, Matteo Rask. Agent Zero. His psychological profile shows that his violent episodes correlate directly with intervals between 'releases.' When he goes too long without... without hurting something, the pain becomes unbearable. That's why he's so unstable. He's in constant agony, and violence is the only relief."

Jon's stomach turned. "Are you saying I'm going to end up like him?"

"No. Your integration is stable. The Creep-6 lattice bonded cleanly with your nervous system. But the behavioral programming is the same. The lattice wants to be used, Jon. And if you fight it too long, it's going to make you suffer."

As if to punctuate her point, the itch surged—a wave of crawling, burning discomfort that made Jon's jaw clench.

"There has to be another way to release the pressure," Jon said. "Exercise. Training. Something non-violent."

"The lattice is optimized for combat efficiency. It wants threat elimination, not cardio." Mira looked at him with something like pity. "I'm sorry, Jon. I built a monster, and Kross put it inside you."

Jon turned back to the window, trying to focus on anything other than the screaming static under his skin.

And that's when he saw them.

Two black SUVs, moving slowly down the street. No markings. Tinted windows. The kind of vehicles that screamed "private military contractor" to anyone with eyes.

"We've got company," Jon said quietly.

Mira was at his side in an instant. "MOSAIK?"

"Most likely. Two vehicles, probably eight to twelve operators." Jon's enhanced vision could see the thermal signatures inside the SUVs—warm bodies, tactical gear, weapons. "They're doing a grid search. Systematic. Professional."

"How did they find us so fast?"

"Doesn't matter. We need to move. Now."

They grabbed their gear—two backpacks with laptops, cash, fake IDs, and the data drive containing all of Mira's stolen research. Jon checked the pistol he'd taken from the Amsterdam safe house. One magazine, fifteen rounds. Not much, but better than nothing.

They made it to the stairwell before the building's front door exploded inward.

---

The MOSAIK fire-team moved with the kind of practiced efficiency that spoke of real combat experience. Not contractors playing soldier—actual operators, possibly ex-Delta or SEAL Team Six, recruited by Kross's consortium and paid enough to not ask questions.

There were eight of them. Full tactical gear, night vision, suppressed rifles, the works. They cleared the ground floor in forty seconds, then started up the stairs.

Jon and Mira were on the fourth floor, moving fast but quiet. The building had multiple stairwells—fire escapes, service stairs, the main staircase. Jon's quantum-enhanced brain was processing escape vectors, calculating probabilities.

*West stairwell: 73% chance of encounter. East fire escape: 58% chance of encounter. Roof access: 41% chance of encounter, but limited egress options.*

The numbers flickered through his consciousness like a heads-up display.

"Roof," Jon whispered. "We go up, then across to the adjacent building."

They hit the roof access door. Locked. Jon didn't bother looking for a key—he just grabbed the handle and pulled. The lock tore free from the frame with a screech of tortured metal.

They burst onto the roof. The Amsterdam dawn was in full bloom now, the sky a watercolor of orange and gold. The adjacent building was twelve feet away, across a gap that would kill a normal human if they misjudged the jump.

Jon didn't hesitate. He grabbed Mira, held her tight against his chest, and ran.

His lattice-enhanced legs generated explosive power, launching them both across the gap. They sailed through the air, Mira's scream muffled against his shoulder, and landed hard on the adjacent roof.

Behind them, the roof access door exploded open. Two operators emerged, rifles up.

"Contact! Targets on the move!"

Suppressed gunfire cracked through the morning air. Bullets whined past Jon's head, close enough that his enhanced hearing could track their supersonic passage.

Jon kept running, Mira clutched in his arms, crossing the roof and looking for another exit.

The itch was howling now. Not just discomfort—actual pain. Like every nerve ending was being scraped with steel wool. His body wanted to stop running, wanted to turn around, wanted to engage the threat.

*Eliminate. Efficient. Eight targets. Threat assessment: manageable. Optimal solution: lethal engagement.*

"No," Jon growled through clenched teeth. He wasn't going to kill them. These were soldiers following orders, just like he used to be. He could evade, escape, disappear.

He didn't have to become what Kross wanted him to be.

They made it to the far edge of the roof. Below was a narrow alley, three stories down. Jon looked back. The two operators were crossing to this building now, making the jump he'd made, with four more right behind them.

Six operators on the roof. Two more probably coming up through the building.

The itch was screaming.

*Turn around. Fight. Kill them. Release the pressure. You know you want to.*

"Jon, what do we do?" Mira's voice was tight with fear.

Jon looked at the alley below. A normal human would break both legs from this height. But he wasn't normal anymore.

"Hold tight," he said.

And he jumped.

---

They hit the alley in a controlled fall, Jon's lattice-reinforced legs absorbing the impact with a crunch of cracked asphalt. He rolled, protecting Mira, and came up running.

The alley opened onto a side street. Early morning traffic was starting—delivery trucks, cyclists, a few pedestrians. Normal people living normal lives, unaware that a superhuman weapon and his civilian companion were fleeing from a kill team.

Jon heard the rappelling lines deploying above. The operators weren't jumping—they were fast-roping down. Professional. Smart.

"They're not giving up," Mira gasped, struggling to keep pace.

"I noticed."

Jon's mind was fracturing, split between two competing imperatives. One part—the part that was still Jon Rivian, still the do-gooder—wanted to protect Mira, wanted to escape, wanted to avoid unnecessary casualties.

The other part—the part that was Agent Six, the part that was Creep-6 code and optimized violence—wanted to turn around and paint the alley red.

The itch was unbearable now. Beyond pain. Approaching agony.

They rounded a corner into a parking garage—a multi-level concrete structure, mostly empty this early in the morning. Jon pulled Mira behind a concrete pillar just as the MOSAIK team rounded the corner behind them.

"We can't keep running," Mira whispered. "They're going to corner us."

She was right. The parking garage was a tactical nightmare—multiple entry points, limited cover, nowhere to hide. The operators would spread out, cut off escape routes, pin them down.

Jon's hands were shaking. The itch was a fire under his skin, a scream in his mind.

*Fight them. Kill them. End the threat. You can do it. You're faster, stronger, better. They're dead men and they just don't know it yet.*

"There's another way out," Jon said, his voice strained. "Loading dock on the north side. We circle around, stay low, we can make it."

"Jon, you're not okay. You need to—"

"I'm fine. Stay close to me."

They moved through the garage, using the parked cars for cover. Jon could hear the operators spreading out, coordinating over comms, tightening the net.

And then his enhanced hearing picked up something that made his blood run cold.

"Command, this is Fire Team Delta. We have the targets contained. Requesting authorization for Protocol Scorch. Confirm: acceptable collateral damage radius is fifty meters."

Protocol Scorch. A thermobaric strike. Just like Warsaw.

They were going to level the parking garage.

With Mira inside.

The itch vanished.

In its place: clarity. Cold, crystalline, perfect.

Jon Rivian—the man who'd pulled Pops from a collapsing building, the man who'd defied an AI to save a teammate—made his choice.

He stepped out from behind the pillar.

---

There were six operators on this level of the garage. Jon's quantum brain catalogued them instantly: positions, weapons, sight lines, threat priorities.

**Target One**: Twenty meters, northeast, behind a concrete pillar. MP7 submachine gun, infrared laser sight.

**Target Two**: Fifteen meters, east, prone position behind a sedan. HK416 rifle, suppressor.

**Target Three and Four**: Thirty meters, south, moving in a two-man team. M4 carbines, grenades on tactical vests.

**Target Five and Six**: Twelve meters, west, on elevated position (second level ramp). SR-25 designated marksman rifles.

The world slowed.

Not metaphorically. Jon's perception actually accelerated, his quantum-enhanced brain processing time at a rate that turned the world into a slow-motion ballet.

He could see an operator's finger tightening on a trigger. Could see a brass casing ejecting from a rifle's chamber, tumbling through the air. Could see the micro-expressions on faces behind tactical masks.

Jon moved.

He crossed twenty meters in 1.2 seconds—faster than any of them could track. Target One was raising his MP7, his mouth opening to shout a warning.

Jon's fist hit the operator's sternum with 8,000 pounds of force.

The man's tactical vest deformed. Ceramic plates shattered. Ribs cracked. The operator flew backward, hit the pillar, and crumpled.

Jon didn't stop. He was already on Target Two, the prone rifleman. The man was trying to swing his HK416 around, but he was moving through honey compared to Jon's speed.

Jon grabbed the rifle barrel, yanked it from the operator's hands, and reversed it. He swung the rifle like a club, hitting the man across the head with the stock. The helmet absorbed most of the impact, but the force was enough to snap the operator's head sideways, and he went limp.

Two down.

Targets Three and Four were reacting now, opening fire. Jon heard the suppressed gunshots—soft coughs, like someone clearing their throat—and watched the bullets coming.

He dodged.

Not all of them. Even he couldn't dodge all of them. But he could predict trajectories, could move into the spaces between the bullets, could make himself a nightmare to hit.

A round clipped his shoulder. The Creep-6 lattice hardened instantly, and the bullet flattened against his skin, falling away.

Jon closed the distance. Thirty meters became twenty, became ten. Targets Three and Four were backpedaling, firing on full auto, and Jon was a ghost, a shadow, death in human form.

He reached them.

His right hand grabbed Target Three's rifle, twisted it sideways, snapped the sling. His left hand shot out, fingers rigid, striking the soft gap between Target Four's helmet and vest—a precise nerve strike that shut down the man's motor control instantly.

Target Four collapsed.

Target Three was trying to draw a sidearm. Jon broke his wrist with a casual backhand, then swept his legs. The operator hit the concrete hard, unconscious before he stopped moving.

Four down.

Targets Five and Six, the designated marksmen on the elevated ramp, had acquired him now. Jon saw them, saw their fingers on triggers, saw the muzzles aligning.

He ran at them.

Bullets cracked past him. One hit his chest, right over his heart. The lattice hardened, caught it, held it. Jon felt the impact but didn't slow.

He reached the ramp support pillar, grabbed it, and climbed.

Not using stairs. Just climbed. His lattice-enhanced fingers found purchase in microscopic imperfections in the concrete, and he scaled the fifteen-foot pillar in three seconds.

Targets Five and Six were directly above him.

Jon erupted onto the upper level like a jack-in-the-box. Target Five was trying to adjust his aim, bringing the SR-25 down to point-blank range.

Too slow.

Jon grabbed the rifle barrel, pulled it toward himself, and used the momentum to yank the operator off balance. The man stumbled forward, and Jon drove a knee into his midsection. The operator's breath exploded out of him, and he went down gasping.

Five down.

Target Six made a smart choice: he dropped his rifle and went for his combat knife. Close quarters, against an opponent who was clearly superhuman, a blade made more sense than a rifle.

The operator was fast. Well-trained. The knife came in low, aiming for Jon's femoral artery.

Jon caught the man's wrist, stopped the blade two inches from his leg.

The operator's eyes widened behind his tactical goggles. He was straining with everything he had, and Jon was holding him one-handed, effortlessly.

Jon twisted. The operator's wrist snapped. The knife clattered to the ground.

Jon released him, and the operator staggered back, cradling his broken wrist, eyes full of pain and fear.

Six down.

Elapsed time: 8.4 seconds.

Jon stood among the unconscious operators, breathing hard, his body vibrating with released energy.

And then the world changed.

It started as warmth. Deep in his chest, right where the lattice hummed its constant song, a sensation of heat began to bloom. Not burning—soothing. Like slipping into a hot bath after being frozen to the bone. But the warmth didn't stop. It grew, intensified, spread.

The sensation radiated outward in waves—not one wave, but dozens, cascading through his circulatory system like ripples on a pond. Each wave was distinct, each one carrying a slightly different quality. The first wave was pure relief, the second was satisfaction, the third was pleasure, the fourth was something beyond pleasure that he didn't have words for.

Everywhere the Creep-6 lattice existed, it was lighting up, singing, celebrating.

His arms felt light, weightless, like he could float. His legs went boneless, and he had to grab a pillar to keep from collapsing. His spine was a column of liquid gold. His skull was filled with warm honey.

And then the chemistry hit like a freight train.

His brain didn't just flood—it *detonated*. Dopamine, serotonin, endorphins, oxytocin, every pleasure chemical his body could produce, all released simultaneously in quantities that would kill a baseline human. His vision didn't just blur—it exploded into hyperclarity for three perfect seconds before whiting out entirely.

For a moment, Jon couldn't see, couldn't hear, couldn't think. There was only *sensation*.

Every nerve ending wasn't just singing—it was screaming in ecstatic chorus. Twenty-seven trillion cells all experiencing the same moment of transcendent reward. His proprioception went haywire—he could feel his heartbeat in his fingernails, could sense the lattice pathways lighting up like a map of constellations beneath his skin.

His muscles didn't just relax—they achieved a state of perfect rest he'd never experienced in his entire life. Every micro-tension he'd been carrying since Delta Force selection, every knot, every chronic ache, dissolved like sugar in hot water.

His thoughts didn't crystallize into clarity—they achieved a state beyond clarity. For thirty perfect seconds, he understood *everything*. The fight made sense. His transformation made sense. The universe made sense. He could see the interconnections, the patterns, the beautiful terrible logic of what he'd become.

The itch—that crawling, burning agony that had been building for hours, that had felt like his nervous system was being scraped with steel wool—was gone. Not just silenced. Not just relieved.

*Inverted*.

Where there had been agony, there was now rapture. The neural pathways that had been screaming in pain were now screaming in pleasure, and the intensity was identical but perfectly reversed. The contrast was so extreme it was almost violent.

Jon's knees gave out. He slid down the pillar, his back against the concrete, his whole body shaking with waves of sensation that wouldn't stop coming.

It felt *good*.

No. It felt *amazing*.

No. Those words were insulting in their inadequacy. It felt *necessary*. It felt like breathing after being held underwater. Like water after days in the desert. Like every cell in his body had been screaming for this moment since the day he'd been born, and now they were finally, gloriously, perfectly satisfied.

Jon had been in combat before. Multiple deployments. Dozens of firefights. He knew the post-combat high—the shaky relief of being alive when you shouldn't be. The adrenaline dump that made your hands tremble and your voice crack. He'd felt pride after successful missions. He'd felt the grim satisfaction of protecting his brothers. He'd felt the hollow victory of surviving another day in hell.

This wasn't any of those things.

This was pure, biochemical pleasure—a reward system that had been engineered to make violence feel like the best thing that had ever happened to him. A designer drug administered by his own nervous system, triggered by breaking human bodies, and calibrated to create the most perfect high a human brain could possibly experience.

And God help him, it was working.

The quench lasted forty-three seconds at full intensity—he could feel each one, could count them like heartbeats. Then it began to fade, not all at once but in those same cascading waves, each one receding like surf pulling back from a beach. The hyperclarity dulled. The golden warmth cooled. The screaming pleasure softened to a gentle hum.

But it didn't disappear completely. It left behind an afterglow—a sense of deep, complete contentment that settled into his bones like nothing he'd ever experienced.

For the first time since waking up in the MOSAIK facility, Jon Rivian felt *good*.

And that terrified him more than anything Kross had done.

"Jon?"

Mira emerged from behind the car where she'd taken cover. She was staring at him, at the six unconscious operators scattered around the parking garage like broken toys.

And Jon realized, with sudden, cold horror, what she must have seen.

Not a soldier defending himself.

Not a man doing what was necessary.

She'd seen him *enjoying* it.

"Jon, what... what did you do?"

He looked down at his hands. They were steady. Perfectly steady. No tremor, no guilt-shake, no adrenaline jitters. His whole body was calm, centered, satisfied. The itch was gone. He felt clear, focused, powerful.

He felt like a god.

And that terrified him.

"I didn't kill them," he said, and his voice sounded strange—distant, like it belonged to someone else. "They're alive. Injured, but alive. I controlled it."

"Controlled it?" Mira took a step toward him, and Jon saw something in her expression he'd never seen before. Fear. Of him. "Jon, you took down six trained operators in less than ten seconds. You moved so fast I couldn't even track you. And your face..."

She trailed off.

"What about my face?" Jon asked, though part of him didn't want to know the answer.

"You were smiling," Mira said quietly. "While you were breaking their bones, while you were throwing them around like dolls, you were smiling. You weren't fighting them, Jon. You were... you were enjoying them."

The words hit like a punch to the gut.

He'd been smiling?

Jon tried to remember. The fight was already blurring in his memory, dreamlike and fragmented. He remembered the clarity. The perfection of movement. The speed. The satisfying impact of fist against flesh, the precise snap of breaking bone, the efficient crumple of bodies falling.

And yes. Yes, there had been pleasure. Not just the quench afterward, but *during*. The fight itself had felt good. Felt right.

Had he been smiling?

The thought made him sick.

"We need to move," Jon said, his voice tight. "They called in a strike. We have maybe five minutes before this building is vapor."

"Jon, look at me."

He didn't want to. Didn't want to see the fear in her eyes. But he forced himself to meet her gaze.

"Are you okay?" she asked, and the question carried so much weight it almost crushed him.

"I'm fine," he said automatically. Then, more honestly: "The itch is gone."

"That's what I'm afraid of." Mira shouldered her backpack, but her eyes never left his. "The itch is gone because you fed it. And now it knows what you like. Now it knows how to make you hunt."

---

They made it out of the parking garage and disappeared into the morning crowd. Behind them, the MOSAIK operators called in their status—six men down, targets escaped, requesting medevac and additional support.

The thermobaric strike was called off. Kross wouldn't risk that kind of attention in the heart of Amsterdam.

Jon and Mira found another safe house—this one a storage unit in an industrial complex south of the city. It was cramped, dark, and smelled like motor oil, but it was secure.

Mira set up her laptop and started running her counter-surveillance protocols. Jon sat against the wall, staring at nothing.

The quench was fading now, ebbing away like the tide. The warmth in his chest was cooling. The euphoria was draining from his system, leaving behind a kind of hollowness. A chemical crash after the high.

And in that hollowness, guilt poured in like water into a sinking ship.

He'd broken bones. Shattered a man's sternum—he'd felt the ribs crack under his fist. Snapped wrists with casual backhands. Driven his knee into organs hard enough to rupture them. Those operators were in hospitals now, being treated for catastrophic injuries that would take months to heal. Some might never fully recover.

Jon had served with men like them. Delta operators, SEALs, Rangers. Professionals who'd volunteered to serve their country, who'd been told they were hunting down a rogue asset, a traitor, a threat.

They'd just been doing their jobs.

And he'd brutalized them.

Worse—he'd enjoyed it.

Jon put his face in his hands. The memory was still there, vivid despite the dreamlike quality. The smile Mira had seen. He could almost feel it now—the muscles of his face pulling into that expression of pleasure while he broke human bodies like they were toys.

He'd promised himself he wouldn't become what Kross wanted. That he'd stay in control. That he'd be the hero, the do-gooder, the man who brought everyone home.

But it had felt so good.

And that was the part that terrified him most. Not that he'd hurt people—he'd been a soldier, violence was part of the job. But the enjoyment. The pleasure. The craving for more that was already starting to build again.

He'd crossed a line he hadn't even known existed. And he'd crossed it smiling.

"I didn't kill them," Jon said quietly.

Mira looked up from her laptop. "What?"

"The operators. I didn't kill them. I could have. Easily. But I didn't."

"No, you didn't." Mira closed her laptop, came to sit beside him. "But Jon, you didn't look like you were trying not to kill them. You looked like you were enjoying yourself."

"I was." The admission felt like ripping off a bandage. "When I was fighting them, it was... it was like the world made sense. Everything was clear. Simple. And when it was over, the feeling..." He shook his head. "I understand now. The itch. The quench. It's a cycle. The lattice creates the pain, and violence is the only relief."

"You're an addict," Mira said gently. "Not to a chemical, but to a state. The lattice is making you addicted to violence."

"Can you stop it?"

"Not without the Nexus upload. The behavioral programming is fundamental to the Creep-6 code. Kross designed it that way deliberately—to create soldiers who crave combat, who seek it out, who excel at it."

Jon's fists clenched. "So what do I do? Just... give in? Become a killing machine?"

"No. You do what you just did." Mira put a hand on his shoulder. "You control it. You satisfy the itch without giving in to the worst impulses. You hurt them, but you didn't kill them. You're still in control, Jon. You're still you."

"For how long?" Jon looked at her. "How long before the line between 'controlled violence' and 'losing myself' disappears?"

Mira didn't have an answer.

They sat in silence for a long time, the weight of what Jon was becoming settling over them like a shroud.

Finally, Mira spoke. "We need to get to the Nexus. The longer you have the control protocol and the behavioral programming active, the worse this is going to get. We need to plan the infiltration, gather resources, and move fast."

"How fast?"

"Days, not weeks. You've gone rogue. Kross is going to throw everything he has at us. MOSAIK assets, hired contractors, maybe even Agent Zero again." She pulled up a file on her laptop. "The Nexus is in Nevada, in the same facility where they rebuilt you. It's a black site, technically doesn't exist. Security is going to be insane."

"What do we need?"

"Intel. Equipment. Access codes. And most of all, a way to get you inside without every alarm in the facility screaming." Mira's fingers flew across the keyboard. "I still have contacts. People who worked on MOSAIK and got forced out like I did. One of them might be able to help."

"Who?"

"Her name is Dr. Eva Rostova. She was the theoretical physicist who developed the quantum-coherence model for the neural lattice. Brilliant woman. Russian defector. She and I were friends before Kross purged anyone who questioned his methods." Mira pulled up a file. "She's in hiding now, somewhere in Eastern Europe. If I can find her, if she's willing to help, she might have access codes or schematics we can use."

"Then find her," Jon said. "I'll... I'll keep the itch under control. Somehow."

Mira looked at him, her expression a mix of sympathy and fear. "Just promise me something, Jon."

"What?"

"Promise me you'll tell me if you start to lose yourself. If the violence starts feeling too good. Promise me you won't let yourself become what Kross wants."

Jon wanted to make that promise. Wanted to believe he could keep it.

But he remembered the quench. The euphoria. The feeling of being perfectly, terrifyingly alive.

"I promise," he said.

It felt like a lie.

---

That night, alone in the dark storage unit while Mira slept, Jon felt the itch starting to return.

It was faint now, barely noticeable, but it was there. A whisper under his skin. A tickle in his nerves. A suggestion in his mind.

*That felt good, didn't it?*

Jon sat with his back against the cold metal wall, staring at nothing in the darkness.

*The fight. The speed. The power.*

He remembered Target One—the way the man's tactical vest had deformed under his fist. The precise microsecond of resistance before the ceramic plate shattered. The satisfying crack of ribs. The man's expression behind the tactical mask, shock and pain and incomprehension.

*You could do it again.*

Target Six. The knife fighter. Jon remembered the man's eyes widening as he realized his wrist was caught in an unbreakable grip. The desperate strain in his muscles, trying with everything he had, and Jon holding him effortlessly. One-handed. The power differential so vast it was almost contemptuous.

And the snap. The wet, organic sound of bone breaking.

*Find another threat. Another target.*

Jon closed his eyes and tried to meditate, tried to center himself the way his Delta Force instructors had taught him. Breathe in for four counts. Hold for four. Exhale for four. Empty the mind. Find the quiet center.

But the meditation didn't work.

His mind kept drifting back. Kept replaying moments. Not the whole fight—specific instants. The perfect ones. The moment his fist connected with the rifleman's helmet. The instant he caught the bullet on his chest and realized he was invincible. The split-second when Target Three's rifle sling snapped and the man's face registered pure terror.

*Feel that clarity again. That perfection. You were alive, Jon. Really, truly alive.*

He'd been a soldier for years. He'd seen combat. He'd killed people—insurgents, enemy combatants, men who were trying to kill him or his team. He'd carried that weight. Mourned them, even. The burden of taking life, even justified life, had been real.

He'd never enjoyed it. It had been necessary. Professional. A hard choice in a hard world.

But this was different.

This time, he hadn't just defended himself. He'd reveled in it. The lattice had turned violence into pleasure, and his brain had learned the lesson perfectly.

The quench had felt better than anything he'd ever experienced. Better than sex. Better than any drug. Better than the pride of a successful mission or the relief of bringing his team home safe.

Violence had felt *perfect*.

And the worst part—the part that terrified him more than anything Kross could do, more than Agent Zero, more than becoming someone's weapon—was that a small, dark voice in the back of his mind was already planning the next time.

Already imagining what it would feel like. The itch building. The sweet agony of anticipation. And then the release. The glorious, transcendent release.

*You know you want to.*

Jon "Jet" Rivian, the do-gooder who brought everyone home, sat in the darkness and felt that voice getting louder.

And wondered how long he had before it was the only voice left.

Before the hero disappeared completely, and was replaced by Agent Six.

Who brought everyone death.

And smiled while doing it.

**End of Chapter 6**
