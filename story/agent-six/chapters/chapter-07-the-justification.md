# Chapter 7: The Justification

The freight train rattled through the German countryside at eighty kilometers per hour, a long metal centipede carrying shipping containers from Rotterdam to Berlin. In one of those containers—a refrigerated unit that had been "accidentally" left unlocked by a bribed dock worker—Jan and Mira huddled in the darkness, wrapped in thermal blankets to mask their heat signatures.

Three days had passed since the parking garage fight in Amsterdam.

Three days of constant movement, of sleeping in shifts, of jumping at every shadow. Three days of Mira working her digital magic, scrubbing their tracks, spoofing their locations, staying one step ahead of MOSAIK's surveillance net.

Three days of the itch slowly, inexorably, building.

Jan could feel it now, a constant low-grade pressure under his skin. Not painful yet, but insistent. Like an itch you couldn't quite reach. His hands were restless, constantly moving—clenching, unclenching, drumming against his thighs.

Mira noticed, of course. She always noticed.

"How bad is it?" she asked, her voice barely audible over the train's rhythmic clatter.

"Manageable," Jan lied.

"Jan—"

"I said it's manageable." He softened his tone. "I'm fine, Mira. Really."

She didn't look convinced, but she let it drop. They had bigger problems than Jan's behavioral programming right now.

They were hunting a ghost.

---

Dr. Eva Rostova had disappeared eighteen months ago, shortly after Elias Kross had purged MOSAIK of anyone who questioned his methods. One day she'd been working at the Nevada facility, the next she was gone—her apartment cleaned out, her bank accounts emptied, her digital footprint scrubbed.

She'd been smart about it. Rostova was a theoretical physicist who specialized in quantum mechanics and had spent three years working for Russian intelligence before defecting. She knew how to disappear.

But Mira was smarter.

"I found a pattern," Mira had said two days ago, her fingers flying across her laptop keyboard. "Rostova used to post on an obscure physics forum under a pseudonym. Academic debates, mostly. Quantum entanglement, consciousness transfer, really esoteric stuff. The posts stopped when she disappeared."

"So she's gone dark."

"Not completely. Someone with the same posting style, same quirks in their mathematical notation, started posting on a different forum six months ago. Different pseudonym, different IP addresses, but it's her. I'd stake my life on it."

"Where is she?"

"The IPs bounce all over Eastern Europe, but there's a pattern. Every third Thursday, the posts originate from somewhere in Prague. Always the same general area—Žižkov district."

"You think she's there?"

"I think she visits there. Regularly. Which means we can find her."

That had been the plan. Get to Prague. Stake out the locations where Rostova's posts originated. Make contact.

But plans changed.

Yesterday, Mira had intercepted MOSAIK communications traffic—encrypted chatter about a "high-value asset" being moved through a secure data hub in Dresden, Germany. The asset in question: complete personnel files for every scientist who'd ever worked on Project MOSAIK, including current locations of anyone in hiding.

If MOSAIK had that data, they'd find Rostova within days.

"We have to get there first," Mira had said. "We need to access that data hub and delete Rostova's file. And while we're in their system, we can grab access codes and schematics for the Nexus."

"What kind of facility are we talking about?"

"It's a commercial data center. MOSAIK rents server space there under shell corporations. Medium security—guards, cameras, biometric locks, but nothing military-grade."

"Can you hack it remotely?"

"No. The servers are air-gapped—physically isolated from the internet. Someone needs to be inside, physically plugged in, to access them."

"So we break in."

"So *I* break in," Mira had corrected. "I need about forty minutes with direct access to their server stack. You create a diversion. Keep security busy while I work."

Jan had agreed. It was a good plan. Clean. Professional.

But now, sitting in the dark freight container with the itch crawling under his skin, he was starting to realize that "creating a diversion" was going to be a problem.

---

They arrived in Dresden at 0200 hours, slipping off the freight train in a railyard on the city's industrial outskirts. The night was cold, crisp, with a sliver of moon hanging in a sky full of stars.

The data center was in the Neustadt district, a former East German industrial complex that had been converted into a tech hub. The building itself was unremarkable—five stories of concrete and glass, surrounded by a chain-link fence topped with razor wire.

Jan and Mira observed from across the street, hidden in the shadows of an abandoned factory.

"Security rotation is every ninety minutes," Mira whispered, watching the feed from a micro-drone she'd deployed. "Four guards on duty. Two patrol the perimeter, two stay inside monitoring cameras and access points. During shift changes, there's a five-minute window when only two guards are active."

"Entry point?"

"Service entrance on the east side. I can spoof the biometric lock with a cloned RFID chip. Once inside, I need to reach the third floor—that's where the MOSAIK servers are housed."

"Cameras?"

"Extensive. But I can loop the feeds once I'm in their security office. That gives me about ten minutes before someone notices the loop."

"And after that?"

Mira looked at him. "After that, they'll know someone's in the building. Security will respond. That's when you create your diversion."

"What kind of diversion?"

"Something that pulls the guards away from the third floor. Something loud and attention-grabbing but not dangerous enough to trigger a full lockdown. Fire alarm, maybe. Or a break-in on the ground floor."

Jan nodded slowly. The itch pulsed, eager.

*Or I could just take out the guards. Quick. Efficient. Permanent.*

He pushed the thought away. "How long do you need?"

"Forty minutes from when I plug in. Maybe less if their security is poorly configured."

"And if something goes wrong?"

"Then you get me out." Mira's eyes were steady. "Whatever it takes."

---

They moved at 0300 hours, during the shift change window.

Mira went in first, slipping through the service entrance like a shadow. Jan watched from across the street, his enhanced vision tracking her progress through the building's windows. She moved with the careful precision of someone who'd done this before—staying low, avoiding sight lines, using the building's blind spots.

She reached the security office on the second floor, bypassed the lock, and slipped inside.

Thirty seconds later, Jan's earbud crackled.

"I'm in. Looping the feeds now." A pause. "Okay, I've got maybe eight minutes before they notice. Heading to the server floor."

Jan settled in to wait. The itch was building, a steady pressure that made his jaw clench. He tried to ignore it, tried to focus on the mission.

Eight minutes became ten.

Ten became fifteen.

"Mira, status?" Jan whispered.

"Hit a snag. The MOSAIK servers have additional encryption I didn't account for. I need more time."

"How much more?"

"Twenty minutes. Maybe thirty."

Jan's hands clenched into fists. Thirty minutes was pushing it. The longer Mira was inside, the greater the chance someone would notice the looped camera feeds or run a random security check.

Twenty minutes became twenty-five.

Jan's earbud crackled again, but this time it wasn't Mira's voice.

It was a guard's voice, coming through Mira's open mic.

"Hey! You're not authorized to be in here!"

Shit.

Jan was moving before he consciously decided to move. He crossed the street in three seconds, hit the chain-link fence, and scaled it in two. The razor wire at the top was a non-issue—his lattice-reinforced skin barely registered the cuts.

He landed inside the compound and sprinted toward the building.

"Mira, talk to me!"

"Guard on the third floor! I'm locked in the server room but he's calling for backup—"

The line cut off.

Jan hit the service entrance. The door was reinforced steel with a biometric lock. He didn't bother trying to hack it. He just grabbed the frame and pulled.

Metal screamed. Bolts tore free. The door came off its hinges.

Jan stepped into the building.

The itch surged, no longer a whisper but a roar.

*Threat. Multiple hostiles. Eliminate.*

---

The building's interior was standard corporate—polished floors, fluorescent lights, motivational posters about "synergy" and "innovation." Jan's enhanced hearing picked up multiple voices, footsteps, the crackle of radio communications.

Three guards converging on the third floor. One more heading toward the ground floor to investigate the destroyed entrance.

Four targets.

Jan's quantum brain ran the scenarios automatically, unbidden.

**Scenario One (Non-lethal)**: Trigger the fire alarm system. Create chaos. Extract Mira in the confusion. Estimated success rate: 64%. Risk of Mira being detained or injured: 23%.

**Scenario Two (Lethal)**: Eliminate all guards. Extract Mira. Sanitize the scene. Estimated success rate: 97%. Risk to Mira: 3%.

The math was simple.

The itch was screaming.

*They're threats. They're in the way. They work for a company that rents to MOSAIK. They're part of the machine. They're fair game.*

Jan took the stairs three at a time, moving toward the ground-floor guard first.

The man was young, maybe twenty-five, with a cheap uniform and a flashlight. He was speaking into his radio, reporting the destroyed entrance, asking for police backup.

He never saw Jan coming.

Jan moved from the stairwell like a ghost. One hand clamped over the guard's mouth, muffling any sound. The other hand went to the back of the man's neck, fingers finding the precise cluster of nerves.

A controlled strike. The guard's eyes rolled back, and he went limp.

Unconscious. Not dead.

*See? You're still in control. Still the hero.*

But the itch didn't care about unconscious. The itch wanted permanent solutions.

Jan dragged the guard into a supply closet, zip-tied his hands, and moved on.

Three guards left.

He reached the third floor. His enhanced hearing tracked their positions—two in the corridor outside the server room, one inside trying to break down the door Mira had locked from the inside.

"—need the master key, the door's reinforced—"

"—police are five minutes out—"

"—whoever broke in downstairs is still in the building—"

Jan stepped into the corridor.

The two guards spun toward him, hands going to their sidearms—9mm Glocks, standard security equipment.

They were slow. So slow.

Jan crossed the distance before they could draw. His left hand struck the first guard's wrist, a precise hit that caused the man's fingers to spasm and release the pistol. His right hand grabbed the second guard's weapon as it cleared the holster, twisted it free, and threw it down the corridor.

Both guards stumbled backward, shocked, off-balance.

Jan could incapacitate them. Nerve strikes, like the guard downstairs. Non-lethal. Clean.

But the itch was howling now, and beneath it, a cold voice was whispering.

*They're guards for a facility that helps MOSAIK. They're part of the system that turned you into a weapon. They're enablers. Complicit.*

*And they're in the way.*

Jan's fist shot out, not a controlled strike but a full-force punch. It hit the first guard's jaw with 6,000 pounds of force.

The man's head snapped sideways. Jan heard the crack of bone—mandible, probably some cervical vertebrae. The guard dropped like a puppet with cut strings.

Still alive. But barely.

The second guard was backing away, terror in his eyes, reaching for his radio.

Jan grabbed him by the throat, lifted him off the ground, and slammed him against the wall. The impact cracked the drywall. The guard's radio clattered to the floor.

"Please—" the guard gasped, his face turning purple.

Jan's grip tightened.

*He's just a guy doing his job. Minimum wage security. Probably has a family. Killing him accomplishes nothing.*

The rational part of Jan's mind screamed these facts.

But the itch was louder.

*He's a threat. Eliminate the threat. Efficient. Clean. Permanent.*

The door to the server room opened.

"Jan, stop!"

Mira's voice cut through the roar in his head like a blade.

Jan froze. He was holding the guard three feet off the ground, the man's face blue, his fingers clawing weakly at Jan's wrist.

"Put him down," Mira said quietly. "Jan, please. Put him down."

Jan's hand opened. The guard collapsed to the floor, gasping and retching.

The itch screamed in frustration.

---

They ran.

Jan grabbed Mira, and they moved through the building at superhuman speed. Behind them, alarms wailed. The third guard—the one who'd been inside the server room—was calling for help, reporting an assault, screaming about a "superhuman attacker."

Jan and Mira hit the street and disappeared into the Dresden night.

They didn't stop running for twenty minutes, didn't slow down until they were kilometers away, deep in the industrial district where no cameras could track them.

Finally, in an alley behind a shuttered warehouse, they stopped.

Mira bent over, hands on her knees, gasping for breath. "Did you... did you get the data?"

"Yes," Mira panted. She pulled a data drive from her pocket. "Rostova's file. Access codes. Schematics. Everything we need."

"Good."

"Jan, what the hell happened back there?"

He didn't answer. The itch was receding now, leaving behind a hollow ache. The quench hadn't come—not fully. He'd stopped himself before killing that guard, but it had been close. So close.

"Those were security guards," Mira continued, her voice rising. "Civilians. They weren't MOSAIK operators. They were just people doing their jobs."

"I know."

"You almost killed that man. I saw your face, Jan. You wanted to."

"I didn't, though. I stopped."

"Because I was there." Mira grabbed his arm, forced him to look at her. "What if I hadn't been? What if you'd been alone? Would you have stopped?"

Jan pulled away. "I don't know."

"That's what scares me." Mira's eyes were haunted. "You're changing, Jan. Every time you give in to the itch, every time you use violence, it gets easier. And you're starting to like it."

"I'm trying to control it—"

"Are you? Or are you just finding better excuses?" She shook her head. "That first guard, the one you took down. You could have just locked him in a room. But you didn't. You wanted to hit something."

Jan's jaw clenched. "We're being hunted by a multi-billion-dollar black-ops organization. Sometimes violence is necessary."

"Necessary is one thing. Enjoying it is another."

They stood in silence for a long moment.

Finally, Mira spoke again, her voice quieter. "I got the data we need. Rostova's last known location was an apartment in Prague, Žižkov district, registered under an alias. If we move fast, we can get there before MOSAIK realizes we have this information."

"How fast?"

"We can catch a train in three hours. Be in Prague by noon."

Jan nodded. The itch was still there, unsatisfied, hungry.

"Jan, promise me something."

"What?"

"Promise me that when we get to Prague, if there's trouble, you'll try the non-lethal option first. Even if the itch is screaming. Even if it hurts. Promise me you'll try."

Jan wanted to make that promise. Wanted to believe he could keep it.

But he remembered the feeling of his hand around that guard's throat. The cold, rational voice explaining why it was justified. Why it was necessary.

*They work for a company that helps MOSAIK. They're part of the machine.*

"I promise," he said.

It felt less like a lie than last time.

That scared him more than anything.

---

The train to Prague was crowded, full of morning commuters and tourists heading to the golden city. Jan and Mira found seats in a quiet car and tried to look like normal travelers—tired, bored, unmemorable.

Mira worked on her laptop, analyzing the data they'd stolen. Jan stared out the window, watching the German countryside blur past.

His mind kept replaying the scene in the data center. The guard's terrified face. The feeling of his throat in Jan's hand. The cold calculation that had almost—almost—led to murder.

*He was just a guy doing his job.*

*He was in the way.*

Both thoughts were true. Both were valid. And that was the problem.

Jan was starting to build a framework, a structure of logic that would let him live with what he was becoming. The guards at the data center weren't innocent—they worked for a company that supported MOSAIK's operations. Agent Zero had to be stopped because he was a weapon that Kross controlled. The operators in the Amsterdam parking garage were soldiers who'd signed up to hunt people.

All of them were, in some way, complicit. All of them were part of the machine.

All of them were fair game.

The rationalization felt good. Clean. Logical.

*I'm not becoming a monster,* Jan told himself. *I'm becoming a scalpel. I'm cutting out the cancer.*

It was a lie, and some part of him knew it. But it was a lie he could live with.

For now.

"Jan, look at this."

Mira turned her laptop toward him. On the screen was a personnel file—Dr. Eva Rostova's complete MOSAIK record.

**Age**: 41. **Nationality**: Russian Federation (defected 2031). **Specialization**: Quantum mechanics, consciousness transfer theory, neural interface design.

**Status**: FUGITIVE. TERMINATION AUTHORIZED.

"Kross wants her dead," Mira said. "Just like he wanted me dead. We're not the only ones being hunted."

Jan studied Rostova's photo. She was a severe-looking woman with sharp features and intense eyes. In the photo, she was wearing a lab coat, standing in front of a whiteboard covered in quantum mechanical equations.

"What did she do?" Jan asked. "Why did Kross purge her?"

"According to her file, she objected to the militarization of the Creep-6 lattice. She wanted to use the technology for medical applications—helping paralyzed patients walk, curing degenerative neural diseases. When Kross redirected the project toward creating weapons, she threatened to go public."

"So he tried to kill her."

"And she ran." Mira pulled up another file. "There's more. Rostova wasn't just a theoretical physicist. Before she defected, she was part of a Russian military research program. Project Chimera. They were trying to create neural interfaces that could let humans control autonomous weapons systems with pure thought."

"Like the control protocol."

"Exactly. Rostova was one of the lead researchers. She understood consciousness-machine interfaces better than almost anyone alive." Mira's eyes widened. "Jan, if anyone can help us break the control protocol, it's her."

"Then we find her. Fast."

The train rattled on toward Prague, carrying them toward their next ally.

Or their next enemy.

Jan couldn't shake the feeling that Eva Rostova knew more than just how to break the control protocol. She knew how the Creep-6 lattice actually worked, down to the quantum level.

Which meant she might know how to stop him, if he became what Kross wanted.

The thought should have been comforting.

Instead, it made him uneasy.

---

They arrived in Prague at 1347 hours. The city was beautiful—a fairy-tale landscape of Gothic spires and baroque architecture, a place where history seemed to seep from every stone.

Jan barely noticed. His attention was on the mission.

Rostova's last known address was in the Žižkov district, a working-class neighborhood of shabby apartment blocks and cheap restaurants. The apartment was on the fourth floor of a Soviet-era building that had seen better decades.

"This is it," Mira said, consulting her laptop. "Apartment 4B, registered to a 'Jana Novotná.' But the utility bills show power consumption patterns consistent with heavy computer use. It's her."

They watched the building from across the street. No obvious security, no signs of surveillance. Just a run-down apartment in a run-down neighborhood.

"Could be a trap," Jan said.

"Could be. But we don't have a lot of options." Mira closed her laptop. "I'll go up first. Knock on the door. Try to make contact peacefully."

"And if it goes wrong?"

"Then you do what you do best."

The itch pulsed, eager.

*What I do best,* Jan thought bitterly. *Violence. That's what I do best now.*

They entered the building. The stairwell smelled like old cooking and mildew. They climbed to the fourth floor, found apartment 4B.

Mira knocked. "Dr. Rostova? My name is Mira Koval. I worked with you on Project MOSAIK. I need to talk to you. It's urgent."

Silence.

Mira knocked again. "Dr. Rostova, please. Elias Kross is hunting both of us. I have information that could help you. We need to work together."

More silence.

Jan's enhanced hearing picked up sounds from inside the apartment—breathing, movement, the faint click of a weapon being readied.

"She's in there," Jan whispered. "And she's armed."

Mira knocked a third time. "I know you're scared. I know you don't trust anyone. But Dr. Rostova, I brought someone you need to meet. Someone who proves everything you warned Kross about was true."

The door opened a crack. A chain lock held it in place.

A woman's face appeared in the gap—older than her photo, more worn, but unmistakably Eva Rostova. She was holding a pistol.

"Mira Koval," Rostova said, her English accented with Russian inflections. "I thought you were dead."

"Kross tried. I got away."

Rostova's eyes flicked to Jan. "And who is this?"

"This," Mira said, "is Agent Six."

Rostova's face went pale. The pistol in her hand wavered.

"That's... that's impossible. The Creep-6 trial was still in testing phase. The neural lattice integration had a 73% failure rate—"

"Not anymore," Jan said. "It worked. I'm the proof."

Rostova stared at him for a long moment. Then she closed the door.

Jan heard the chain lock sliding free.

The door opened wide.

"Come in," Rostova said quietly. "Quickly. Before someone sees you."

They stepped into the apartment. It was small, cramped, filled with computer equipment and stacks of research papers. The windows were covered with blackout curtains.

Rostova closed and locked the door behind them. She was still holding the pistol, but it was pointed at the floor now.

"Show me," she said to Jan.

"Show you what?"

"The lattice. Show me your integration."

Jan hesitated, then pulled off his jacket and shirt. In the dim light of the apartment, the graphene lattice beneath his skin was visible—faint hexagonal patterns, like circuitry etched into his flesh.

Rostova approached, her scientific curiosity overriding her fear. She pulled a small device from her pocket—some kind of scanner—and ran it over Jan's chest.

The device beeped, displaying data that Jan couldn't interpret.

Rostova's eyes widened. "Bozhe moy," she breathed. "Quantum coherence at 99.7%. Systemic integration complete. Neural lattice fully bonded." She looked up at Jan. "You're... you're what we dreamed of. The perfect synthesis of human and machine."

"I'm what Kross made me," Jan said. "A weapon."

"Yes." Rostova's expression hardened. "Yes, I suppose you are." She lowered the scanner. "Why are you here?"

"We need your help," Mira said. "The control protocol—"

"Is active?" Rostova finished. "Of course it is. Kross would never create a weapon he couldn't control." She looked at Jan with something like pity. "How does it feel? Being a puppet?"

"Like I want to rip the strings off," Jan said.

Rostova smiled—a cold, bitter smile. "Good. That means you're still human enough to save." She gestured to the computer equipment. "Sit. Both of you. We have much to discuss."

As they settled into chairs, as Rostova began pulling up files and schematics, Jan felt the itch recede slightly. They'd found an ally. Someone who understood the technology, who might be able to help.

But in the back of his mind, the cold voice that was becoming more familiar whispered a different truth.

*She's useful. For now. But if she becomes a problem...*

Jan pushed the thought away.

But it didn't go far.
