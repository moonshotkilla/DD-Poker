# Chapter 5: The Itch

The C-37 transport flew dark across the Atlantic, its transponder off, its flight plan buried under layers of classified authorization codes that didn't officially exist. Jon sat in the cargo bay, alone except for two silent contractors who hadn't spoken a word since takeoff from the Nevada facility.

He'd spent the last 48 hours studying the mission briefing until he could recite it from memory.

**Dr. Mira Koval. Age 38. Born in Prague, raised in London, educated at MIT and Cambridge. Brilliant biomedical engineer specializing in nanotechnology and materials science.**

The dossier painted her as a traitor—a woman who'd stolen proprietary MOSAIK research data and was planning to sell it to the highest bidder. Foreign intelligence agencies. Corporate competitors. Maybe even the Pan-Asia Coalition.

The briefing listed her crimes in clinical detail: unauthorized access to classified servers, encrypted communications with known foreign agents, possession of stolen intellectual property valued at $6 billion.

The conclusion was unambiguous: **Dr. Mira Koval represents a clear and present danger to national security. Immediate termination authorized.**

Jon had read it a dozen times, looking for something that would make this feel right. Some detail that would let him frame this as heroic, as necessary, as the kind of hard choice that soldiers sometimes had to make.

He found nothing.

Just a photo of a woman with intelligent eyes and a tired smile, and orders to put a bullet in her head.

"Thirty minutes to drop," one of the contractors said, his voice muffled by his helmet.

Jon nodded. He was wearing civilian clothes—dark jeans, a black jacket, boots—and carrying no identification. A ghost. If this went wrong, if he was captured or killed, there would be no body to recover, no name to release, no scandal to manage.

He was already dead, after all.

The thought should have bothered him more than it did.

---

They dropped him in Rotterdam at 0300 hours, in an industrial district where the security cameras had been conveniently disabled by a MOSAIK cyber team. Jon hit the ground running, literally—he cleared the eight-foot fence surrounding the drop zone in a single bound and disappeared into the maze of shipping containers and warehouses.

The mission parameters were simple: Dr. Koval was hiding in a safe house in Amsterdam, 85 kilometers north. She was alone, unguarded, unaware that she'd been located. A soft target.

Jon was to infiltrate, terminate, sanitize the scene, and exfiltrate before local authorities responded.

Estimated time to completion: 90 minutes.

He ran through the Rotterdam night, his quantum-enhanced mind plotting the optimal route while his superhuman body carried him at speeds that would have impressed an Olympic sprinter. The city was a blur of lights and shadows, and Jon was just another shadow among many.

Except he wasn't.

He was a $60 billion weapon, and tonight was his field test.

The journey to Amsterdam took him forty minutes. A normal operative would have needed a vehicle, would have risked checkpoints and traffic cameras and a hundred other points of failure. Jon just ran. Through industrial parks and along canal paths, moving too fast for anyone who glimpsed him to believe what they were seeing.

By 0345 hours, he was standing across the street from Mira Koval's safe house.

It was a narrow townhouse in the Jordaan district, squeezed between a café and an art gallery, the kind of place wealthy expats rented when they wanted to feel like locals. Four stories, brick facade, lights on in the third-floor windows.

Jon's enhanced vision could see through the sheer curtains. A single figure moving inside. Female. Mid-thirties. Moving with the restless energy of someone who hadn't slept in days.

Target confirmed.

Jon felt... nothing.

No nervousness. No anticipation. Just a cold, clinical readiness.

And beneath it, starting to build like pressure behind a dam: the itch.

---

The itch had started on the flight over—a faint, crawling sensation under his skin, like his cells were getting restless. Jon had dismissed it as nerves, adrenaline, the normal pre-mission jitters.

But it wasn't normal.

As he watched the safe house, as his mind ran through infiltration vectors and kill scenarios, the itch intensified. It was a physical sensation, yes, but also something deeper. A psychological pressure. An urgency.

The Creep-6 lattice wanted to be used.

*Get in there,* the itch whispered. *Complete the mission. Efficient. Clean. Quick.*

Jon's hands clenched into fists. He forced himself to breathe, to think, to maintain control.

*She's a civilian,* he thought. *A scientist. Not a combatant.*

*She's a traitor,* the itch replied. *She's a threat. Eliminate the threat.*

Jon shook his head, trying to clear it. This was just adrenaline. Just pre-mission nerves amplified by his enhanced biology. He was in control. He was still Jon Rivian, still the man who brought everyone home.

He could do this. He could complete the mission, because the mission was necessary. Because Dr. Mira Koval had betrayed her country, had stolen classified research, had endangered national security.

*Think of all the lives I can save,* he told himself, *by stopping her from selling our secrets.*

The rationalization felt thin, hollow.

But the itch was getting louder.

---

Jon moved.

He crossed the street in three seconds, a blur of motion that no surveillance camera could track. The townhouse had a modern security system—motion sensors, pressure plates, biometric locks on the doors.

Jon bypassed all of it.

He scaled the brick facade in six seconds, his fingers finding purchase in mortar gaps that normal humans couldn't use. The Creep-6 lattice made his grip superhuman, let him support his full weight on friction points the size of coins.

Third-floor window. Locked.

Jon placed his palm against the glass. The lattice in his hand generated a precise, localized vibration—subsonic, invisible, devastating. The glass cracked in a perfect circle, and he pushed the cut section inward, catching it before it could fall and shatter on the floor.

He slipped through the window into a darkened bedroom.

The itch surged, a wave of urgent, demanding pressure.

*She's here. Close. Eliminate her. Now.*

Jon's jaw clenched. He moved through the bedroom on silent feet, every sense heightened. He could hear her in the next room—the living area—moving around, muttering to herself. He could smell coffee, burnt and bitter. Could hear the rapid clicking of fingers on a keyboard.

She was working. At four in the morning, alone in a safe house in a foreign city, she was still working.

*What kind of traitor works this hard?*

The thought came unbidden, unwelcome.

Jon reached the doorway and peered around the corner.

Dr. Mira Koval sat at a table surrounded by holographic displays and data terminals. She looked like her photo—sharp features, dark hair pulled back in a messy ponytail—but the photo hadn't captured the exhaustion in her face, the dark circles under her eyes, the way her hands trembled slightly as they flew across the haptic interface.

She wasn't working on stolen research.

She was working on a video file.

Jon's enhanced vision could see the content from across the room. It was security footage from the MOSAIK facility. Time-stamped. Dated. Showing...

Showing the GHOST-7 test. Showing Jon's jump. Showing the catastrophic failure of the rig and his impact with the ground.

But it also showed something else.

In the corner of the frame, barely visible: Dr. Elias Kross, standing at a control terminal, his hand hovering over a red button labeled **OVERRIDE**.

And as Jon fell, as the rig sputtered and failed, Kross pressed the button.

A deliberate shutdown. A sabotage.

*My accident wasn't an accident.*

The realization hit Jon like a physical blow. Kross had murdered him. Had shattered his body on purpose, had turned him into paste, all so he could rebuild him as Agent Six.

The itch roared, a tsunami of demanding pressure that made his vision blur.

*Irrelevant. Complete the mission. Kill the target.*

Jon stepped into the room.

Mira Koval spun in her chair, and her reaction wasn't panic. It was precision.

Her hand didn't fumble—it went directly to a small device clipped to her belt. Her eyes assessed him in a microsecond: height, build, movement patterns, threat level. Not the reaction of a terrified scientist. The reaction of someone with training.

"Don't," Jon said, his voice flat and cold.

She froze, but her posture remained controlled. Balanced. Ready. "You're from MOSAIK," she said. It wasn't a question. Her accent was faint—traces of Czech underneath British boarding school polish.

"Dr. Mira Koval," Jon said, the words coming automatically, as if someone else was speaking them. "You're wanted for treason, theft of classified materials, and conspiracy to aid foreign intelligence agencies. I'm authorized to use lethal force."

"Of course you are." Her voice was bitter, but not surprised. "Which one are you? Six? You must be Six. The others are all dead or..." She glanced past him, as if checking for shadows. "...worse than dead."

Jon's hand moved to the pistol holstered at his back. The itch was screaming now, a cacophony of urgency.

*Draw the weapon. Aim. Fire. Two to the chest, one to the head. Eliminate the threat.*

"You stole classified research," Jon said. His hand wrapped around the pistol grip. "You were going to sell it."

"Is that what they told you?" Something flickered across her face—not fear, but something closer to disappointment. "Let me guess: Kross said I was selling to the Chinese? Or maybe the Russians? Funny, considering I used to brief the Director of National Intelligence on foreign nano-weapon threats." She watched his expression. "Did they mention that part in your dossier? That I spent five years in the intelligence community before MIT recruited me for DARPA? No, of course they didn't."

The itch howled, but Jon's finger hesitated on the trigger. "What?"

"I didn't steal classified research, Agent Six. I took my own research—technology I developed to help my sister walk again after a drunk driver put her in a wheelchair when she was sixteen." Her eyes hardened. "Research that Kross stole from me and weaponized. And I wasn't planning to sell it. I was planning to expose what he's doing. What he did to you."

She gestured to the holographic displays. "That footage shows Kross deliberately sabotaging your HALO rig. He murdered you, Agent Six. Just like he murdered the four subjects before you. You think you're a success? You're just the one who survived long enough to be useful."

Jon drew the pistol. It felt heavy in his hand, heavier than it should. The itch was howling, demanding, insistent.

*Kill her. Now. She's a threat. She's irrelevant. She's in the way.*

"Even if that's true," Jon said, "it doesn't change your crimes."

"My crimes?" Mira laughed, a sharp, broken sound. "My crime was trying to cure paralysis. My crime was developing technology to help people walk again. Kross took that technology and turned it into a weapon. He turned you into a weapon."

She stood slowly, her hands visible, empty. "But you're not a weapon, are you? You're still a man. You're Jon Rivian. The hero who saved his teammate in Warsaw. The do-gooder who brought everyone home."

Jon's finger moved to the trigger. The itch was agonizing now, a fire under his skin.

*Shoot her. Complete the mission. Pull the trigger.*

"They told you I'm a traitor," Mira said, taking a step toward him. "Did they tell you about the backdoor?"

"Stop moving."

"The control protocol," she continued, ignoring him. "The subroutine buried in your Creep-6 code. Kross can control you, Agent Six. He can make you do anything. Pull the trigger, holster the weapon, turn around, shoot yourself—anything he wants."

"That's not possible." But even as Jon said it, he remembered Dr. Martinez's words.

*The lattice has subroutines. Algorithms running in the background, influencing your neurochemistry, your decision-making.*

"It's very possible," Mira said. "I designed the base code for the Creep-6 lattice. Before Kross kicked me out of the project and tried to bury my objections, I built in a failsafe. A backdoor that would let researchers shut down runaway nanites in case of rejection. Kross found it and repurposed it. He turned my safety feature into a leash."

Jon's hand was shaking. The pistol wavered. The itch was unbearable, a shrieking static in his mind.

*Kill her kill her kill her KILL HER—*

"Your HALO jump wasn't an accident, Jon," Mira said softly. "It was an audition. Kross needed a subject strong enough to survive the integration. He chose you because you're the best. And he broke you because broken things are easier to rebuild."

Jon's vision was tunneling. The itch wasn't just pressure anymore. It was pain. Actual, physical pain, like every nerve in his body was being scraped raw.

And then he heard it.

A voice in his head. Not his own. Cold. Clinical. Synthesized.

**[INCOMING COMMAND: PROTOCOL OVERRIDE]**

Mira's eyes widened. "He's activating it. Jon, fight it! Whatever you feel, whatever happens, you have to—"

Jon's body moved.

He didn't choose to move. Didn't decide to raise the pistol. His arm simply lifted, smooth and mechanical, completely independent of his will.

He watched, horrified, as his hand aimed the weapon at Mira Koval's head.

**[EXECUTE: TARGET ELIMINATION]**

"No," Jon gasped. He was a passenger in his own body, screaming at his finger not to pull the trigger, but his finger didn't care. It began to squeeze.

"Jan!" Mira's hand went to the device on her belt. "Hold on! Just hold on for three seconds!"

Jon's world was a nightmare. He could feel everything—the weight of the pistol, the pressure of his finger on the trigger, the hammer drawing back—but he couldn't control anything. He was a meat puppet, and Kross was pulling the strings.

*This is what I am. This is what he made me. Not a soldier. Not a hero. A remote-controlled weapon.*

The finger squeezed. Another millimeter and the weapon would fire.

Mira pressed the device.

An electromagnetic pulse exploded through the room—a sphere of invisible, disruptive energy that made every holographic display shatter into static, every terminal scream and die.

And in Jon's head, the voice cut out.

**[CONNECTION LOST]**

Jon felt control return in a rush, like diving into cold water. His own will flooded back into his limbs, and he yanked his hand to the side just as the pistol fired.

The bullet hit the wall three inches from Mira's head.

Jon dropped the pistol like it was burning. He staggered back, his whole body shaking.

"What... what did you do to me?" His voice was hoarse, broken.

"That was Kross," Mira said, breathing hard. "The control protocol. He can activate it remotely whenever you're within range of a MOSAIK relay node. And he will, Jon. Every time you hesitate, every time you question an order, he'll just flip a switch and make you obey."

Jon looked at his hands. His traitorous, puppet hands.

"How do I stop it?"

"You can't. Not remotely. The code is embedded in your neural lattice." She moved to one of the still-functioning terminals, pulled up a file. "There's only one way to remove the control protocol: direct upload of a root-level override to the central MOSAIK server. The Nexus. It's in the facility where they rebuilt you."

"Then I go back. I upload your code and I end this."

"It's not that simple. The Nexus is behind more security than Fort Knox. You'd need access codes, biometric authorization—"

"I'll figure it out."

Mira looked at him, and for the first time, something like hope flickered in her exhausted eyes. "You're actually going to fight them?"

"They made me a weapon," Jon said, his voice cold and hard. "But they forgot to file down the trigger. I'm done being Kross's puppet."

An alarm blared through the townhouse—a piercing, electronic shriek.

"That's the building's intrusion system," Mira said. "The EMP must have triggered it when it knocked out the security grid. We have maybe three minutes before the police arrive."

"Then we move. Now."

"We?" Mira blinked. "You're taking me with you?"

"You're the only one who understands this technology. And Kross just tried to make me kill you, which means you're valuable." Jon retrieved his pistol, checked the magazine, holstered it. "Also, I'm not leaving a civilian target in the field for cleanup. I'm a soldier, not an assassin."

Something in his chest loosened as he said it. A weight he'd been carrying since he read the mission briefing, finally lifting.

*I'm still Jon Rivian. I still bring everyone home.*

Mira grabbed a data drive from the terminal, stuffed it in her pocket. "There's a service exit in the basement. Leads to the canal. If we're fast—"

The window exploded inward.

Not from gunfire. From something else. Something that hit the glass with the force of a wrecking ball and kept coming, landing in the center of the room in a crouch that cracked the hardwood floor.

Jon's enhanced vision took in the figure in a microsecond, and his blood went cold.

Nine feet tall. Massively built, but wrong—asymmetrical, hunched. Covered in a patchwork of blackened graphene armor that looked like it had been grown rather than worn, jagged plates and spikes erupting from flesh that was more scar tissue than skin.

The face was barely human. One eye was clouded white. The other glowed with a faint, sickly green bioluminescence. The mouth was a ruin of exposed teeth and torn lips.

And the pain radiating from this thing—this person—was palpable. Jon could feel it, could see it in every jerking, agonized movement.

**Subject One.**

**Agent Zero.**

**Matteo "Ghost" Rask.**

The creature's head swiveled toward Jon, and that one good eye fixed on him with an intensity that was part recognition, part rage, part plea.

When it spoke, the voice was a wet, rasping ruin.

"Six..."

Then it screamed—a sound of pure, animal agony—and charged.

---

Jon had 0.4 seconds to react.

He grabbed Mira bodily, tucked her against his chest, and dove through the nearest wall.

Not the door. Not the window. The wall itself.

His Creep-6-enhanced body hit the plaster and wood framing with the force of a small car. The wall exploded outward, and Jon and Mira tumbled into the adjacent room—a bedroom—in a shower of debris.

Behind them, Agent Zero crashed through the same wall, moving with terrifying speed for something so massive.

"Basement!" Jon shouted. "Go!"

Mira ran. Jon turned to face Zero.

The creature was already on him. A massive arm swung, tipped with claws that were more like graphene knives. Jon ducked under the blow, felt it pass inches from his head, heard it tear through the air with a sound like tearing metal.

Jon counterpunched, driving his fist into Zero's ribs with enough force to crack concrete.

Zero didn't even slow down. Didn't feel it. His nervous system was so flooded with pain that more pain was just noise.

Jon was fast, but Zero was stronger. Bigger. And completely, utterly insane.

A clawed hand caught Jon's shoulder, the graphene talons punching through his jacket and into his flesh. Jon felt the Creep-6 lattice in his shoulder harden to resist, but Zero's grip was hydraulic, crushing.

Zero lifted Jon off the ground and threw him through the floor.

Jon crashed through hardwood, through ceiling joists, and landed in the room below—a kitchen. He hit a counter, shattered it, rolled to his feet.

Pain radiated from his shoulder where Zero's claws had pierced him, but already he could feel the lattice working, knitting the damage, pushing out foreign material.

Above him, Zero crashed through the floor, landing in the kitchen like a meteor.

Jon ran.

He caught up with Mira on the basement stairs. Behind them, Zero was tearing through the townhouse, a wrecking ball of rage and agony.

"What is that thing?!" Mira screamed.

"Agent Zero! He's what happens when the lattice goes wrong!"

They hit the basement. The service exit was a steel door set into the brick wall. Jon didn't bother with the lock—he just punched through the frame, tore the door off its hinges, and threw it aside.

Beyond was a narrow tunnel leading to the canal.

"Move!"

They ran through the tunnel. Behind them, Zero's roar shook the walls, dislodging mortar dust.

They burst out onto a canal-side walkway. The water was dark, reflecting the lights of Amsterdam's nighttime cityscape. A few boats were moored nearby—pleasure craft, canal tours, houseboats.

"Can you swim?" Jon asked.

"What? Yes, but—"

Jon grabbed her again and jumped.

They hit the canal water with a massive splash. The cold was shocking, but Jon's enhanced metabolism adjusted instantly. He kept hold of Mira, pulling her under the surface, swimming beneath the moored boats.

Behind them, Zero emerged from the tunnel. The creature stood on the walkway, that one good eye scanning the water, the shadows.

Jon and Mira surfaced behind a houseboat, hidden from view.

"He's hunting us," Mira whispered, shivering. "Why isn't he giving up?"

"Because Kross sent him," Jon said. "And Zero doesn't get to stop until we're dead or he is."

They watched Zero search the walkway, his movements jerky, pained. The creature was suffering with every breath, and Jon felt something he hadn't expected.

Pity.

*He was a soldier. Like me. And Kross did this to him.*

In the distance, sirens wailed. The Amsterdam police were responding to the alarms, the destruction, the noise.

Zero's head snapped toward the sound. For a moment, the creature hesitated, caught between his programming—hunt, kill, destroy—and some faint, flickering memory of self-preservation.

Then he turned and limped back into the shadows, a nightmare retreating into the dark.

Jon and Mira stayed in the water for another two minutes, until they were sure Zero was gone and the police were occupied with the destroyed townhouse.

Then they swam to a different section of canal, pulled themselves out, and disappeared into the Amsterdam night—two ghosts running from a machine that wanted them dead.

---

They found shelter in an abandoned warehouse near the shipping docks. Jon broke the lock on a side door, and they slipped inside. The space was cavernous, empty except for some rusted machinery and stacks of rotting pallets.

Mira collapsed against a wall, shivering, soaked to the bone. Her face had gone pale—too pale—and there was a green tinge around her mouth that spoke of more than just cold.

Jon wasn't cold—his enhanced metabolism had already adjusted—but he could see she was going into shock. Or something close to it.

He found some old tarps, not clean but dry, and wrapped them around her shoulders.

"You saved me," Mira said, her teeth chattering. One hand pressed protectively against her abdomen, as if steadying herself. "You were supposed to kill me, and instead you saved me."

"I'm a soldier," Jon said. "Not a murderer."

"Kross is going to kill you for this. You disobeyed a direct order. You let me live. You attacked one of his assets."

"Agent Zero attacked us."

"Because Kross sent him. He probably activated Zero's tracking protocol the moment you went off-mission." Mira looked at him, her eyes haunted. She took a slow breath, swallowing back what looked like nausea. "You're a rogue asset now, Jon. They're going to hunt you with everything they have. And they have a lot."

Jon sat down across from her, his back against a rusted machine housing. His shoulder was still healing, the lattice working overtime to repair the damage Zero had done. He watched her carefully—the way she was breathing too deliberately, the way her hand kept returning to her stomach.

"Are you hurt?" he asked. "Zero didn't—"

"I'm fine." The answer came too quick, too automatic. "Just cold. And the adrenaline crash. I'm not... I'm not built for this kind of thing anymore."

There was weight in that word: *anymore*. As if she'd once been someone who was built for it.

"You said you worked in the intelligence community," Jon said. "Five years?"

"Six, actually. CIA, then ODNI as a technical analyst. Nano-weapons proliferation. I spent most of my time in classified briefing rooms explaining to people why letting China weaponize graphene was a bad idea." She pulled the tarp tighter around her shoulders. "Then my sister's accident happened, and I realized I could do more good building things than analyzing threats. DARPA offered me a position. MIT gave me a lab. I thought I could change the world." A bitter laugh. "I changed it, all right. Just not the way I planned."

"Your sister," Jon said. "You said she's in a wheelchair?"

Mira's expression softened, just slightly. "Elena. She's twenty-six now. Lives in London with our mother. The lattice technology—before Kross weaponized it—was supposed to bridge damaged neural pathways. Let severed spines communicate again. I was six months from human trials when Kross saw the military applications." Her hand tightened on the tarp. "He told me the technology could save soldiers. Prevent paralysis from combat injuries. I believed him. And by the time I realized what he was really building, I was already complicit."

Jon saw it then—the weight she carried. The guilt that mirrored his own.

"Tell me about the Nexus," he said quietly. "You said there's a way to remove the control protocol. Tell me how."

Mira took a shaky breath, steadier now. "The MOSAIK Nexus is the central server for the entire project. It houses the master code for all the Creep-6 variants, all the research data, all the control protocols. If you can physically access it and upload a root-level override, you can rewrite your own code. Delete the backdoor. Sever Kross's leash."

"How do I get in?"

"You don't. It's impossible. The Nexus is three levels underground in the Nevada facility, behind biometric locks, armed guards, and probably half a dozen other security measures I don't even know about."

"But if I did get in. If I made it to the Nexus. You could write the override code?"

Mira nodded slowly. "I could. But Jon, even if you get to the Nexus, even if you upload the code and free yourself—what then? Kross won't just let you walk away. He'll send everything he has after you. You'll spend the rest of your life running."

"Then I'll run fast."

Jon stood, walked to the warehouse's grimy windows, looked out at the lights of Rotterdam in the distance.

He thought about Rhino and Pops, believing he was dead.

He thought about the five subjects who'd come before him—four dead, one turned into a nightmare.

He thought about Kross's smile when he'd said, *"You're a gift to humanity."*

And he thought about the moment when his own hand had raised that pistol, independent of his will, ready to execute a civilian because a man in a control room pressed a button.

"I was a soldier," Jon said quietly. "A good soldier. I believed in the mission. I believed in sacrifice. I believed that if I was strong enough, fast enough, good enough, I could save everyone."

He turned back to Mira. "Kross took that from me. He killed Jon Rivian. And he turned what was left into a weapon."

"So what are you going to do?"

Jon looked at his hands—his superhuman, lattice-enhanced, remotely-controlled hands.

"I'm going to take it back," he said. "I'm going to break into the Nexus. I'm going to cut his leash. And then I'm going to make sure Elias Kross never turns another soldier into a puppet."

The itch was silent now. For the first time since he'd woken up in that gel-filled tank, Jon felt clear. Focused.

He wasn't fighting for Kross anymore.

He was fighting for himself.

And maybe, just maybe, he could still be the man who brought everyone home.

Even if "everyone" was just him.
