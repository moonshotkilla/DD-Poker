# Chapter 12: Genesis

**One Month Later**
**Prague, Czech Republic**

The itch had become a constant companion.

Not unbearable, not yet. But always there, humming beneath the surface like electricity through a wire. Jon had learned to manage it, to live with the pressure the way people lived with chronic pain—by accepting it as part of the new normal.

He sat in a café on Wenceslas Square, drinking coffee he didn't need and watching a building across the street through the window. To anyone observing, he looked like another tourist taking in Prague's baroque architecture. No one noticed the way his eyes tracked every person entering and exiting the building. No one saw the calculations running behind those eyes, the quantum-level processing that catalogued faces, gaits, threat assessments.

No one knew they were sharing a café with a weapon.

Jon's enhanced hearing picked up conversations from a dozen tables. His quantum brain translated Czech, German, Russian, filtering for anything relevant. Nothing. Just tourists and locals living normal lives, blissfully unaware that someone was about to die.

The building across the street was a high-end gallery specializing in Eastern European art. Very expensive. Very exclusive. Very convenient for laundering money.

And on the third floor, in a private office that wasn't listed in any directory, Aleksandr Sokalov was conducting business.

Jon had spent three weeks tracking him. Three weeks of following digital breadcrumbs, intercepting encrypted communications, piecing together the movements of a man who'd built an empire on weapons, death, and human suffering.

Three weeks of the itch building, whispering, demanding.

But Jon had been patient. Because this wasn't like Amsterdam or Dresden. This wasn't survival. This wasn't necessity.

This was a choice. A hunt. A judgment.

And Jon wanted to get it right.

---

His tablet—heavily encrypted, bounced through a dozen proxy servers—displayed the file he'd compiled on Aleksandr Sokalov.

**Age**: 52. **Nationality**: Russian. **Occupation**: "International art dealer" (cover). **Real occupation**: Arms trafficker, weapons broker, shadow financier.

The public-facing Sokalov was a respectable businessman. Charity galas. Art donations. A patron of culture.

The real Sokalov was something else entirely.

Jon scrolled through the file, reviewing crimes he'd already memorized but needed to see again. Needed to justify what he was about to do.

**2029**: Brokered sale of chemical weapons to Syrian regime. Estimated deaths: 3,000 civilians.

**2031**: Funded development of autonomous killer drones deployed in African conflict zones. Estimated deaths: unknown, but thousands.

**2033**: Primary investor in Project MOSAIK's "Breach Protocol"—the program that created Agent Zero. Leased failed Creep-1 prototypes for use as enforcers. Estimated subjects tortured/killed: 12.

That last one made Jon's hands tighten on the tablet. Matteo Rask's face flashed in his mind—the agony, the pleading, the final moment of peace when Jon had ended his suffering.

Sokalov had funded that torture. Had profited from it. And when MOSAIK collapsed, he'd disappeared into his legitimate business operations, untouchable.

The law couldn't reach him. His connections ran too deep, his money bought too many protections, his lawyers were too good.

But Jon could reach him.

The itch pulsed, eager.

*Soon,* Jon promised it. *But not yet. We do this right.*

---

At 1900 hours, the gallery closed. Staff left through the main entrance—security guards, curators, administrative personnel. Jon watched them go, his enhanced vision identifying each person, matching faces to the employee roster he'd hacked.

Sokalov's bodyguards left at 1930—two ex-Spetsnaz contractors who earned six figures to keep their employer breathing. They did a security sweep, locked the building, activated the alarm system.

Standard procedure: Sokalov always stayed late in his third-floor office, doing the real work after the legitimate business closed. He had a private exit, his own security protocols, a panic room if things went wrong.

A fortress built on paranoia and blood money.

Jon left the café at 1945, crossed the street, and approached the building from a blind spot in the camera coverage. The alarm system was top-tier—motion sensors, pressure plates, thermal imaging.

It took Jon ninety seconds to bypass all of it.

The Creep-6 lattice made his body a perfect thermal chameleon when he needed it to be. The motion sensors couldn't track something moving at superhuman speeds between their sweep patterns. The pressure plates required weight distribution that Jon's enhanced body could manipulate to register as wind variance instead of human presence.

He was inside the building at 1948.

The gallery was dark, illuminated only by emergency lighting and the city glow filtering through windows. Jon moved through it like a ghost, his enhanced vision turning darkness into perfect clarity.

He took the stairs to the third floor. No elevators—too easy to trap, too easy to hear.

Sokalov's office was at the end of a corridor lined with paintings worth more than most people's homes. Jon paused outside the door, listening.

Inside: heartbeat (elevated, stressed), keyboard clicking, muttered Russian curses. Sokalov was alone, working, unaware he had company.

The itch was a roar now, demanding release. But Jon forced himself to wait, to center, to remember why he was here.

*Not because the itch demands it. Because he deserves it.*

The distinction mattered. It was the only thing that separated him from being a mindless killer.

He opened the door.

---

Aleksandr Sokalov looked up from his computer, startled. He was a heavy man, running to fat in his fifties, with the kind of expensive suit that couldn't quite hide a sedentary lifestyle. His face—jowly, florid—showed shock, then confusion, then the beginning of fear.

"Who the hell are you?" Sokalov demanded in Russian. "This is private property! How did you—"

He reached for something under his desk. Gun, probably. Panic button, possibly.

Jon crossed the office in 0.4 seconds. His hand clamped down on Sokalov's wrist before the man's fingers could close on whatever he was reaching for.

"Don't," Jon said in perfect Russian. The quantum lattice had absorbed languages like a sponge absorbed water. "You pull that trigger or press that button, and this ends badly for you."

Sokalov stared at him, eyes wide. "What do you want? Money? I have money. Access codes. Whatever you—"

"I want you to understand why you're going to die tonight."

The words came out cold, clinical, certain. Jon released Sokalov's wrist and stepped back, giving the man space. Not because he needed to—Sokalov couldn't possibly escape—but because he wanted Sokalov to see this coming.

"You're going to kill me." Sokalov's voice trembled. "Over what? Business?"

"Over this." Jon pulled out his tablet, displayed the file. "Aleksandr Sokalov. Arms dealer. Financier of war crimes. Investor in illegal human experimentation."

Sokalov's face went pale as Jon scrolled through the evidence. Bank records. Communications. Photographs of failed Creep-1 subjects, twisted and broken, kept in Sokalov's private "collection" before they'd been disposed of.

"I... I'm a businessman," Sokalov stammered. "I invest in technologies. Legal technologies. If there were... ethical violations... I wasn't directly involved—"

"You funded Project MOSAIK's Breach Protocol," Jon interrupted. "You knew exactly what it was. You saw the failed subjects. And you used them. Leased them from Dr. Kross like they were equipment instead of human beings."

"That's not—"

"Subject One. Matteo Rask. Agent Zero." Jon's voice was quiet now, deadly. "You paid to watch him fight. Paid to see what a corrupted Creep-1 lattice could do to human flesh. You found it entertaining."

Sokalov's mouth opened and closed like a fish drowning in air.

"I met him," Jon continued. "I looked into his eyes and saw what your money had created. A man trapped in agony, begging for death. And when I gave him that mercy, when I ended his suffering, I made myself a promise."

Jon leaned forward, his eyes locked on Sokalov's.

"I promised I'd find everyone who profited from his torture. And I'd make them understand exactly what they'd done."

"Please—" Sokalov's voice cracked. "Please, I have children. Grandchildren. I'll give you anything. Name your price—"

"There is no price. This isn't a negotiation." Jon straightened. "This is a judgment."

The itch was singing now, a chorus demanding release. But Jon kept it controlled, channeled, focused.

"You're going to die tonight, Mr. Sokalov. Not quickly. Not painlessly. You're going to experience a fraction of what those subjects felt. What Matteo Rask felt." Jon's voice was perfectly calm, perfectly cold. "And then I'm going to erase you. Delete every file, every record, every piece of evidence that you ever profited from their suffering. You won't be remembered as a philanthropist or an art collector. You'll just be... gone."

Sokalov lunged for the desk drawer. Fast, for a man his age. Desperate.

Not fast enough.

Jon's hand shot out, grabbed Sokalov's reaching arm, and twisted. The snap of breaking bone was loud in the quiet office.

Sokalov screamed.

And the itch finally, gloriously, got what it wanted.

---

Jon worked for forty-seven minutes.

Not out of cruelty. Not out of sadism. But because the itch demanded thoroughness, and Jon had learned to satisfy it while maintaining his code.

Sokalov had funded torture. So Jon showed him what torture felt like.

Broken bones. Nerve clusters. Pressure points that made the body scream even when the voice gave out.

The Creep-6 lattice made Jon's control perfect. He could inflict pain with surgical precision, could push Sokalov to the edge of shock without crossing into unconsciousness.

Every minute, Jon reminded Sokalov why this was happening. Named the subjects. Described their suffering. Made the man understand that this wasn't random violence—it was consequence.

And when Sokalov finally broke, when he was beyond words and coherent thought, Jon ended it.

One strike. Precise. The same neural cluster he'd used on Agent Zero.

Instant. Final.

Aleksandr Sokalov's body slumped in the chair, eyes open but empty.

And the quench hit.

---

It was different from before.

The parking garage fight had been survival, unsatisfying and hollow. The Stalkers had been a thrill, intoxicating and terrifying. Agent Zero had been mercy, producing no quench at all.

This was something else.

The euphoria was there—the chemical flood of dopamine and endorphins that made Jon's whole body sing. But beneath it was something deeper. A sense of completion. Of rightness.

He'd hunted a predator. Delivered justice to someone who'd escaped it. Made the world marginally safer, marginally better.

The itch was silent now, satisfied in a way it had never been before.

And Jon understood, with perfect and terrible clarity, what he'd become.

Not a mindless killer. Not a psychopath. Not even really a vigilante in the traditional sense.

He was a predator who hunted other predators. A judge who delivered sentences the law couldn't. A weapon who chose his own targets.

He was Agent Six. And this was his purpose.

*Think of all the bad guys I can kill,* he thought, the echo of his own words from weeks ago.

The rationalization had become reality. The code had become his compass.

And the worst part—the part that should have terrified him but didn't—was how right it felt.

---

Jon spent the next hour erasing Aleksandr Sokalov from history.

The office computer held encrypted files detailing decades of arms deals, war crimes, human trafficking. Jon's quantum brain processed them all, identifying patterns, tracking money flows, uncovering networks.

He uploaded everything to Rostova's server. Evidence that would, eventually, bring down Sokalov's entire operation. Associates. Clients. Enablers.

More names for Jon's list.

Then he wiped the computer. Physically destroyed the hard drives. Set fire to the paper files.

The gallery's alarm system would detect the fire in approximately eight minutes. Emergency services would respond in twelve. By the time they arrived, the third floor would be ashes, and Sokalov's body would be unidentifiable except through dental records.

The official story would be simple: tragic fire, one casualty, no foul play suspected. Sokalov's empire would crumble without him, his assets seized by rivals and governments.

No one would ever know what really happened.

Except Jon.

And that was enough.

---

He exited the building at 2103 hours, vanishing into Prague's nighttime crowds. Just another tourist, unremarkable and forgettable.

The itch was quiet now, purring contentedly like a fed cat. Jon knew it would return—it always returned—but for now, there was peace.

He walked along the Vltava River, watching the city lights reflect on the dark water. Prague was beautiful at night, all Gothic spires and baroque architecture, a city that had survived wars and occupations and regime changes.

A city that didn't know a monster walked its streets.

*Am I a monster?* Jon asked himself.

*Yes,* the cold voice answered immediately. *But not the kind that preys on the innocent. The kind that preys on other monsters.*

It was a fine distinction. A thin line. But it was the only line Jon had left.

His tablet buzzed. An encrypted message from Rostova.

**"Data received. Processing Sokalov's files now. Preliminary count: 47 individuals in his network with similar profiles. Sending you the list."**

A moment later, names and faces filled Jon's screen. Arms dealers. Human traffickers. Shadow financiers. War criminals hiding behind legitimate businesses and legal protections.

People the law couldn't touch.

People Jon could.

He scrolled through the list, his quantum brain categorizing, prioritizing, planning.

*This is your life now,* he thought. *Hunt. Judge. Execute. Repeat.*

*And you're okay with that?*

Jon looked at his reflection in a shop window. Same face. Same body. But the eyes were different—harder, colder, more certain.

The man who'd been Jon "Jet" Rivian, the do-gooder Delta operator who brought everyone home, was gone. Had died in that HALO jump, or during the MOSAIK integration, or somewhere on the road from Amsterdam to Nevada.

What remained was Agent Six. A weapon. A judge. A predator.

And yes, he was okay with that.

Because the alternative was worse. The alternative was letting the itch win completely, becoming a mindless killer with no code, no purpose, no compass.

At least this way, he aimed his violence at targets that deserved it. At least this way, he could pretend he was still doing something good.

*Think of all the bad guys I can kill.*

The rationalization had become his religion.

---

Jon found a cheap hotel in the Žižkov district, paid cash, used a fake ID. The room was small, anonymous, perfect.

He sat on the bed and opened his tablet, pulling up a secure connection to Rostova.

Her face appeared on the screen—older, more tired than when he'd first met her, but her eyes were still sharp.

"Agent Six," she said. "I saw the news. Gallery fire in Prague. One casualty."

"Sokalov," Jon confirmed.

"Good." No judgment in her voice. No moral hand-wringing. Just simple acknowledgment. "His network is already fragmenting. Without his money and connections, it'll collapse within months. You did the world a favor."

"I did myself a favor," Jon corrected. "The itch needed feeding."

"And you fed it on someone who deserved it. That's progress, Agent Six."

"Is it?" Jon looked at the list of names on his screen. "Or is it just a more sophisticated rationalization?"

Rostova was quiet for a moment. Then: "Does it matter? The end result is the same. Bad people die. The world becomes marginally safer. Your condition is managed. Everyone wins."

"Except the bad people."

"Fuck the bad people." Rostova's voice was hard. "Sokalov funded the torture of twelve human beings. He watched them suffer for entertainment. He deserves whatever you did to him."

"What if I start to enjoy it too much? What if the line between 'deserving' and 'convenient' starts to blur?"

"Then I'll stop you." Rostova met his eyes through the screen. "That's our deal, remember? I provide intelligence, you hunt. But if you cross the line, if you start targeting innocents, I upload everything about you to every intelligence agency on Earth. And they'll hunt you down."

"You'd do that?"

"Without hesitation. Because Agent Six, you're useful. But you're also the most dangerous weapon ever created. And weapons need handlers, whether they like it or not."

Jon nodded slowly. It was comforting, in a twisted way. Knowing someone was watching. Someone who could, theoretically, stop him if he went too far.

Even if that someone was across an ocean and relied on Jon's own conscience to trigger the safeguard.

"The list you sent," Jon said. "I want to start with the next priority target. Who is it?"

Rostova pulled up a file. "Victor Dragunov. Former GRU colonel, now private military contractor. He ran the facility where Matteo Rask was captured and sold to Kross. Currently operating in Ukraine, using the war as cover for human trafficking operations."

A photo appeared on screen—a hard-faced man in his sixties, military bearing, cold eyes.

"He's well-protected," Rostova continued. "Fortified compound outside Kyiv. Mercenaries. Heavy weapons. Getting to him will be significantly harder than Sokalov."

Jon studied the file, his quantum brain already processing approach vectors, vulnerabilities, assault plans.

The itch purred, interested.

"How long to compile full intelligence?" Jon asked.

"Two weeks. Maybe three."

"Do it. And Rostova?"

"Yes?"

"Thank you. For the list. For the oversight. For... for keeping me aimed."

Rostova's expression softened slightly. "You're welcome, Agent Six. For what it's worth, I think you're doing the right thing. Or at least, the least wrong thing you could be doing."

"That's a hell of an endorsement."

"It's the best I can offer." She paused. "How are you feeling? Really?"

Jon thought about that. About the quench fading, leaving him hollow and satisfied at the same time. About the list of names waiting for him. About the fact that he'd tortured and killed a man tonight and felt no guilt.

"I feel like I finally understand my purpose," he said honestly. "I'm not human anymore. Not really. But I'm not just a weapon either. I'm something in between. Something necessary."

"And the itch?"

"Quiet. For now. But it'll be back. It's always back."

"Then I'll have another target ready when you need one."

They ended the call.

Jon lay back on the cheap hotel bed, staring at the water-stained ceiling. Somewhere in the city, emergency services were responding to the gallery fire. Somewhere, Sokalov's family was about to receive terrible news. Somewhere, the network he'd built was beginning to crumble.

And Jon felt nothing except a cold, satisfied certainty that justice—his justice—had been served.

*This is who you are now,* he told himself. *A hunter. A judge. A monster with a code.*

*And you're going to spend the rest of your life feeding the itch on people who deserve to die.*

The thought should have been horrifying.

Instead, it felt like coming home.

---

**Three Weeks Later**
**Location Classified**

Jon stood on a rooftop in Kyiv, watching the sun set over a city at war. Smoke rose from distant artillery strikes. The sound of gunfire echoed through abandoned streets.

And two kilometers away, in a fortified compound that looked like something from a military thriller, Victor Dragunov was conducting business.

Jon had spent three weeks preparing for this. Three weeks of reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, planning. Three weeks of the itch building, demanding, insisting.

But he'd been patient. Because this target was harder. More dangerous. More likely to go wrong.

And Jon had learned his lesson. The hunt wasn't just about satisfying the itch. It was about being smart. Surgical. Efficient.

About being the right kind of monster.

His tablet showed the assault plan, refined through countless iterations. Entry vectors. Guard rotations. Kill zones. Contingencies.

It was a good plan. He'd probably survive.

And if he didn't—well, there were worse ways to die than taking a monster with you.

The itch pulsed, eager.

Jon checked his gear one last time. Minimalist. Professional. Lethal.

He thought about Mira, wondered where she was, hoped she was safe. Thought about Rostova, sitting in her Prague apartment, providing overwatch from a thousand miles away. Thought about Matteo Rask, finally at peace in the Nevada desert.

And he thought about Dr. Elias Kross, trapped in his paralyzed body, unable to move, unable to speak, forced to live with what he'd created.

All the ghosts that haunted him. All the choices that had led him here.

Jon "Jet" Rivian was dead. Had been dead for months.

But Agent Six was very much alive.

And Agent Six had work to do.

He stood, stretched, felt the Creep-6 lattice hum with readiness beneath his skin.

The itch whispered its anticipation.

And Jon smiled.

Not the smile of a hero. Not the smile of a villain.

The smile of a predator who'd just spotted prey.

He stepped off the rooftop, four stories up, and dropped into the Kiev night.

The hunt had begun.
