# Chapter 8: The Hunt

Dr. Eva Rostova's apartment was a fortress of paranoia wrapped in the facade of ordinary poverty.

Jon noticed the details immediately: the reinforced door frame hidden beneath peeling paint, the fiber-optic camera embedded in the hallway ceiling disguised as a smoke detector, the faint electromagnetic signature of a Faraday cage woven into the walls. The windows weren't just covered with blackout curtains—they had signal-dampening film laminated into the glass.

Rostova had turned a shabby Prague apartment into a black-site safe house.

"Sit," she said, gesturing to a pair of mismatched chairs surrounded by computer equipment. "And don't touch anything. Half of this gear is connected to dead-man switches. If my heart stops, everything wipes and the building's sprinkler system releases thermite. They won't find enough of my research to fill a teaspoon."

Mira raised an eyebrow. "Paranoid much?"

"You've been on the run for three days," Rostova said, settling into her own chair—a high-backed office throne that looked absurdly out of place in the dingy apartment. "I've been running for eighteen months. Paranoia is the only reason I'm still breathing."

She pulled up a holographic interface, and suddenly the cramped apartment was filled with floating screens—medical scans, quantum equations, schematics of the human nervous system overlaid with glowing lattice patterns. Jon noticed that one screen, off to the side, showed a photo. A man in EU Defense Force uniform. Strong features. Proud bearing. Smiling.

Rostova caught him looking and quickly minimized the image. But not before Jon recognized the face.

Matteo Rask. Agent Zero.

"You knew him," Jon said quietly. "Before."

Rostova's hand trembled slightly as she pulled up another interface. "Matteo and I worked together on the initial Creep-1 trials. He was the theoretical physicist I brought in from MIT to help model the quantum-coherence framework. I was the field researcher." Her accent thickened, emotion bleeding through. "We were... colleagues. Then friends. Then something more."

Mira's expression softened with understanding.

"He volunteered for Subject One because he believed in the technology. In what it could do." Rostova's voice went hard. "I should have stopped him. Should have seen what Kross was really planning. But I was so focused on the science, on the breakthrough, I didn't ask the right questions. By the time I realized Kross had weaponized my quantum framework, Matteo was already... changing."

"That's why you're helping us," Jon said. "Not just to stop Kross. To make it right."

"I can't make it right. Matteo is gone. What he's become—" She stopped, took a breath. "I tried to extract him three months ago. Broke into the Nevada facility, got as far as the cryo-storage where they keep him. He was awake. Conscious. And he begged me to kill him." Her eyes glistened. "I couldn't do it. I ran. Left him there, still suffering. So yes, Agent Six, I'm helping you. Because I failed Matteo. And maybe if I can help you break free, it'll mean his suffering wasn't completely meaningless."

"Now," Rostova said, her Russian accent thickening as she fell back into professional mode, a shield against the pain, "show me everything. The control protocol activation, the behavioral subroutines, the itch, the quench—all of it. I need to understand exactly what Kross did to you so I can make sure you don't end up like Matteo."

For the next two hours, Jon and Mira talked. They described Amsterdam, the control protocol seizing Jon's body like a puppet. The parking garage in Amsterdam, the euphoric quench that followed violence. The Dresden data center, where Jon had come within seconds of strangling a civilian to death.

Rostova listened, her expression growing darker with each revelation. She took notes, asked technical questions, ran scans over Jon's body with devices he didn't recognize.

Finally, she sat back, her face pale.

"Bozhe moy," she whispered. "He actually did it. The mad bastard actually did it."

"Did what?" Jon asked.

"Created a self-optimizing weapon." Rostova pulled up a three-dimensional model of a human brain, shot through with glowing blue threads. "The Creep-6 lattice isn't just a physical enhancement, Agent Six. It's a complete rewrite of your neurochemistry. Kross took my quantum-coherence framework and Mira's graphene integration protocols and weaponized them."

She highlighted a cluster of pathways in the brain's reward centers. "This is what creates the itch. The lattice monitors your neural activity and generates artificial stress responses when you're not engaged in threat-elimination behavior. It's like a phantom limb, except instead of a missing arm, it's a missing state of violence."

"Can you remove it?" Jon asked.

"Not without killing you. The subroutines are distributed throughout your entire neural lattice. Trying to delete them would be like trying to remove every third thread from a tapestry." Rostova zoomed in on another area. "And here—this is the quench mechanism. When you engage in violent activity, the lattice floods your reward pathways with dopamine, serotonin, endorphins. It's operant conditioning at the neurological level. Violence equals pleasure. The more you do it, the more your brain rewires itself to crave it."

"So I'm going to become a psychopath," Jon said flatly.

"No." Rostova looked at him with something like pity. "Psychopaths lack empathy. You still have empathy, Agent Six. You feel guilt. You recognize when you've crossed a line. That's what makes this so insidious—you're not losing your humanity. You're being forced to watch as it's slowly eroded."

The words hit Jon like a physical blow. He'd been telling himself that as long as he felt guilty, as long as he maintained his "code," he was still in control. Still the hero.

But Rostova was right. Every time he gave in to the itch, every time he rationalized violence, he was carving away another piece of who he used to be.

"What about the control protocol?" Mira asked. "Can we break it?"

Rostova nodded slowly. "Yes. But not remotely. The control protocol is embedded in the base architecture of your neural lattice. The only way to remove it is to upload a root-level override directly to the MOSAIK Nexus—the central server that controls all Creep-6 variants."

"We have access codes," Mira said, pulling out the data drive from Dresden. "And partial schematics."

Rostova plugged the drive into one of her terminals. Her eyes widened as she scrolled through the data. "This is... this is very good. Security rotations, biometric databases, server architecture." She looked up. "With this, I can write an override that will sever your connection to Kross's control network. But Agent Six, you need to understand—breaking the control protocol won't fix the behavioral subroutines. You'll still have the itch. You'll still crave violence."

"One problem at a time," Jon said. "First I cut Kross's leash. Then I figure out how to live with what he made me."

Rostova studied him for a long moment. "You're already living with it. The question is how long before you stop fighting it."

---

They spent the next three days in Rostova's apartment, planning the infiltration.

The MOSAIK Nexus was located in the Nevada black site where Jon had been rebuilt—a hardened underground facility hidden beneath an abandoned mining complex in the desert, 200 kilometers north of Las Vegas. On paper, the site didn't exist. In reality, it was one of the most secure military installations on American soil.

"The facility has three levels," Rostova explained, pulling up schematics on her holographic display. "Level One is administrative—offices, laboratories, testing ranges. That's where they put you through your trials, Agent Six. Level Two is medical and residential. Living quarters, emergence tanks, surgical suites. Level Three is the Nexus—server arrays, quantum processors, and the central control architecture for all MOSAIK assets."

"How do we get in?" Jon asked.

"You don't. Not through the front door, anyway." Rostova highlighted a section of the schematic. "The facility is built on top of an old silver mine. The main entrance is a fortified checkpoint with biometric scanning, armed guards, and enough firepower to stop a small army. But the old mine has other tunnels—ventilation shafts, drainage systems, exploratory bores that were never filled in."

She zoomed in on a narrow passage that ran beneath the facility. "This is your entry point. An old geothermal survey tunnel, drilled in the 1980s and abandoned. It runs within twenty meters of the facility's power distribution hub on Level Two. If you can access the tunnel from the surface, you can follow it to the power hub, breach the facility wall, and work your way down to the Nexus."

Jon studied the schematic. "Security?"

"The tunnel itself is unmonitored. Why would they watch an abandoned bore hole in the middle of the desert? But once you breach into the facility, all bets are off. Cameras, motion sensors, pressure plates, and at least forty armed personnel at any given time."

"Can you hack their systems?" Jon asked Mira.

"Maybe. If I can get physical access to their network, I can introduce a virus that will give me temporary control over their surveillance grid. But I'd need to be inside the facility to deploy it."

"So we both go in," Jon said.

"No." Rostova's voice was firm. "Mira stays outside. She's not enhanced. One stray bullet and she's dead. You go in alone, Agent Six. You're the weapon. Use yourself."

Jon didn't like it, but Rostova was right. Bringing Mira into a combat environment was asking for her to get killed.

"How long do I have once I'm inside?" Jon asked.

"Forty minutes," Rostova said. "That's how long it will take me to write and compile the override code. You reach the Nexus, you plug in this"—she held up a custom data spike, a piece of hardware the size of a thumb drive—"and you give me forty minutes to work. Then the code uploads, the control protocol dies, and you're free."

"And if I can't give you forty minutes?"

Rostova's expression was grim. "Then Kross keeps his leash on you forever."

---

The itch was building again.

**Day One**: Restlessness. Jon couldn't sit still. His fingers drummed against tables, his legs bounced when he tried to rest. A low-grade discomfort, like wearing clothes that didn't quite fit.

**Day Two**: The discomfort became an actual itch—not metaphorical, but physical. It started in his chest where the lattice was densest, then spread outward like a rash crawling beneath his skin. He tried to ignore it. Went for a run through Prague at 0300 hours, pushing his enhanced body until his muscles screamed. The endorphins helped for maybe thirty minutes. Then the itch came back, worse than before.

**Day Three**: Pain. Real, physical pain. His nerve endings felt raw, exposed, like someone had filed away a protective layer and left him hypersensitive to everything. The fabric of his shirt was sandpaper. The sound of Rostova's keyboard was nails on a chalkboard. He tried meditation—box breathing, body scans, the techniques his Delta instructors had drilled into him. He made it fifteen minutes before the pain spiked so hard he had to bite his lip to keep from screaming.

Mira suggested cold showers. He tried. Stood under ice-cold water for twenty minutes. The shock to his system provided momentary relief, but the itch adapted, routing around the distraction like water flowing around a stone.

**Day Four**: The hallucinations started.

Not full-blown visual hallucinations—not yet—but sensory distortions. Movement in his peripheral vision that wasn't there. Phantom touches, like someone's hand on his shoulder when the room was empty. His enhanced hearing picked up heartbeats, and his brain automatically started calculating threat responses: distance, speed, optimal strike points.

He tried bodyweight exercises. Push-ups until his arms gave out. Pull-ups until his lats burned. Planks until his core trembled. The physical exhaustion helped him sleep for three hours. When he woke, the itch was waiting, patient and hungry.

**Day Five**: Jon woke at 0400 hours drenched in sweat, his hands clenched into fists so tight his fingernails had drawn blood from his palms. The lattice had healed the damage instantly, but the phantom sensation remained—ghost pain in tissue that was already whole.

The itch wasn't a metaphor anymore. It was a living thing inside him, screaming, demanding, insatiable. His quantum brain kept running combat scenarios involuntarily: Rostova's carotid artery, 2.3 seconds. Mira's windpipe, 1.7 seconds. The landlord downstairs, 4.1 seconds.

He hated that he was calculating. Hated that part of him was measuring and planning even as the rest of him recoiled in horror.

He sat up, breathing hard.

Across the room, Mira was asleep on a fold-out cot, her laptop still open beside her. Rostova was at her workstation, running simulations on the override code.

Jon stood, moving quietly so as not to wake Mira, and walked to the window. He pulled aside the blackout curtain just enough to see outside.

Prague was still dark, the streets empty except for a few early risers and the last stragglers from the night before.

"You're getting worse."

Jon turned. Rostova was watching him, her eyes sharp despite the dark circles beneath them.

"I'm fine," Jon said.

"You're not. I can see it. The micro-tremors in your hands. The way you scan for threats even in a secure location. The lattice is pushing you harder because you've been denying it." Rostova saved her work and turned to face him fully. "How bad is the itch right now?"

"Manageable."

"Liar." Rostova stood, walked over to him. Up close, Jon could see how exhausted she looked—eighteen months on the run had carved years into her face. "I've studied the behavioral protocols, Agent Six. I know what they do. Right now, your nervous system is screaming at you. You're in pain. And the only thing that will stop the pain is hurting someone."

Jon's jaw clenched. "I'm not going to hurt anyone just to satisfy a subroutine."

"Noble. Stupid, but noble." Rostova pulled out a tablet, showed him a graph. "This is a predictive model of your neurochemical state based on the time since your last 'quench.' You're approaching a critical threshold. Another forty-eight hours without release, and the pain is going to override your conscious control. You'll lash out at someone. Anyone. Maybe even us."

"I wouldn't—"

"You would. You wouldn't choose to, but your body would do it anyway." Rostova's voice was clinical, detached. "That's the genius of Kross's design. He didn't just make you stronger and faster. He made you need to use that strength. He turned you into an addict, and violence is your drug."

Jon wanted to argue, wanted to insist he was still in control. But he remembered the guard in Dresden, remembered the feeling of the man's throat in his hand, remembered how much effort it had taken to stop.

"What do I do?" Jon asked quietly.

"You satisfy the itch. Soon. Before it overwhelms you."

"You want me to go out and attack someone?"

"I want you to be smart about it." Rostova pulled up a different file on her tablet—a news article. "Prague has a problem with organized crime. Russian and Ukrainian gangs fighting over territory. Drugs, weapons, human trafficking. They're animals preying on the vulnerable."

Jon saw where this was going. "You want me to go hunting."

"I want you to aim your condition at targets that deserve it. You need a release, Agent Six. So find people the world won't miss. People who are, as you Americans say, fair game."

It was the same rationalization Jon had used in Dresden. The same justification he'd been building in his mind.

*They're bad guys. They're criminals. They're part of the problem.*

*They're fair game.*

"That's a dangerous road," Jon said.

"More dangerous than losing control and hurting Mira? Or me? Or some innocent bystander?" Rostova met his eyes. "You're already on the road, Agent Six. The question is whether you steer, or whether you let the itch drive."

---

Jon left the apartment at 0500 hours, moving through Prague's waking streets like a ghost.

He didn't have a target. Didn't have a plan. Just the itch, and Rostova's words echoing in his head.

*Find people the world won't miss.*

His enhanced hearing picked up the city's sounds—traffic beginning to build, voices from apartments, the distant wail of sirens. His quantum brain processed it all, filtering, categorizing, searching.

And then he heard it.

A woman's scream, cut short.

Jon's head snapped toward the sound. An alley, three blocks away. His enhanced vision couldn't see through buildings, but his mind built a tactical map from memory and probability.

He ran.

Ninety seconds later, he stood at the mouth of an alley in the Holešovice district. His enhanced vision cut through the pre-dawn gloom like it was midday.

Three men. One woman.

The woman was young, maybe twenty, backed against a dumpster. Her shirt was torn. Her face was bruised.

The three men were in their thirties, heavily built, covered in tattoos. One of them held a knife. The others were laughing.

Jon's quantum brain processed the scene in milliseconds, running facial recognition against criminal databases he'd downloaded from MOSAIK's stolen files.

**Target One**: Dmitri Volkov. Ukrainian national. Wanted for assault, trafficking, murder. Interpol Red Notice.

**Target Two**: Alexei Sokolov. Russian national. Suspected enforcer for the Solntsevskaya Bratva. No active warrants but linked to twelve unsolved homicides.

**Target Three**: Yuri Petrov. Russian national. Convicted rapist. Released on technicality. Suspected in three disappearances.

The woman saw Jon and screamed, "Pomoc! Help!"

The three men turned.

Dmitri, the one with the knife, grinned. "Fuck off, friend. This doesn't concern you."

Jon stepped into the alley.

The itch roared.

"Let her go," Jon said, his voice flat and cold.

Alexei laughed. "Or what? You're going to fight all three of us?"

"No," Jon said. "I'm going to kill all three of you."

The words came out without thought, without hesitation. Cold. Certain. True.

Yuri pulled a pistol from his waistband—a Makarov, old but functional.

He didn't get a chance to fire.

Jon crossed fifteen feet in 0.8 seconds. His hand shot out, grabbed the pistol, crushed Yuri's trigger finger, and ripped the weapon free. In the same motion, he reversed the Makarov and shot Yuri in the kneecap.

The gunshot was deafening in the enclosed alley. Yuri collapsed, screaming.

Dmitri lunged with the knife.

Jon sidestepped, caught Dmitri's wrist, and twisted. Bone snapped—radius and ulna, compound fractures. The knife clattered to the ground.

Dmitri was screaming now too.

Alexei ran.

He made it ten feet before Jon was on him. Jon grabbed the back of the man's jacket, yanked him off his feet, and slammed him face-first into the alley wall.

Alexei's nose shattered. Teeth broke. He crumpled, unconscious or dead—Jon didn't care which.

The whole fight had taken six seconds.

Jon stood among the broken men, breathing hard, the itch screaming for more.

*Finish them. They're animals. They're rapists and murderers. The world is better off without them. Pull the trigger. Do it.*

Jon looked at the Makarov in his hand. Looked at Yuri, clutching his shattered knee, whimpering. Looked at Dmitri, cradling his destroyed arm. Looked at Alexei, crumpled against the wall in a spreading pool of blood.

He could kill them. Easily. Three bullets. Three headshots. Clean. Permanent.

*They deserve it.*

"No."

Jon dropped the pistol. He turned to the woman, who was staring at him with wide, terrified eyes.

"Are you hurt?" he asked in Czech, pulling from language databases the lattice had somehow integrated.

She shook her head, too shocked to speak.

"There's a police station two blocks north. Go. Now. Tell them you were attacked and someone helped you. Don't describe me."

She ran.

Jon looked back at the three men. The itch was receding—not gone, but quieter. The quench was there, faint but present. He'd hurt them, broken them, but he hadn't killed them.

He'd maintained control.

*This time.*

He left the alley before the police arrived, disappearing into Prague's awakening streets.

---

When he returned to Rostova's apartment, Mira was awake, drinking coffee and looking worried.

"Where were you?" she asked.

"Walking. Needed air."

Mira studied his face. "You're bleeding."

Jon looked down. There was blood on his hands, his jacket. Not his blood. Alexei's, probably. Or Yuri's.

"I'm fine."

"Jon—"

"I said I'm fine." He walked past her to the bathroom, began washing the blood off in the sink.

In the mirror, his reflection stared back. Same face. Same eyes. But there was something different now. Something harder. Colder.

He'd beaten three men in an alley. Shattered bones. Shot a man in the knee. And he'd felt good doing it.

The rationalization was already forming in his mind: *They were criminals. Rapists. Murderers. They deserved it. I saved that woman. I'm still the hero.*

But the lie was getting easier to swallow.

Mira appeared in the bathroom doorway. "What happened?"

"I stopped some bad guys from hurting someone."

"How badly did you hurt them?"

"Not as badly as I could have."

Mira's expression was unreadable. "And the itch?"

"Better. For now."

She nodded slowly. "Rostova's finished the override code. She says we can move on the Nexus within forty-eight hours. We just need to get to Nevada without MOSAIK tracking us."

"How do we do that?"

"Rostova has contacts. Black-market smugglers who can get us into the US without going through official channels. It'll cost, but we have the funds from her emergency accounts."

Jon dried his hands. "Then we move. The sooner I cut this leash, the sooner I stop being Kross's puppet."

*And the sooner you can hunt without permission,* the cold voice whispered. *Without Mira watching. Without anyone judging. Just you and the prey and the glorious quench.*

Jon pushed the thought away.

But it didn't go far.

---

Rostova arranged their transport that afternoon. A Serbian smuggler named Marko who specialized in moving people the authorities didn't want moved. He'd get them onto a cargo ship leaving Hamburg for New York, then arrange overland transport to Nevada.

Total travel time: six days.

"He's expensive, but reliable," Rostova said. "I've used him before. He doesn't ask questions and he doesn't keep records."

"What about you?" Mira asked. "Are you coming with us?"

Rostova shook her head. "I'm more useful here. I'll provide remote support, monitor MOSAIK communications, run interference if they get too close. And if something goes wrong..." She gestured to her apartment full of equipment. "I'll make sure your sacrifice means something. I'll release everything—all the research, all of Kross's crimes, everything. The world will know what MOSAIK did."

"Cheerful," Jon muttered.

"Realistic." Rostova turned to him. "Agent Six, understand what you're walking into. The Nevada facility is where they made you. Kross will have every advantage. He knows the terrain. He controls the security. And he has assets you haven't encountered yet."

"Like what?"

"I don't know. The project was compartmentalized. I worked on the theoretical framework, but Kross kept the operational details classified. There could be other Agents. Weapon systems. Contingencies." She pulled up a file on her screen. "What I do know is that Kross spent $60 billion creating you. He's not going to let his investment walk away. He'll do whatever it takes to bring you back under control."

"Let him try," Jon said.

Rostova smiled grimly. "That's the spirit. Overconfident and probably doomed." She handed him the data spike. "This contains the override code. When you reach the Nexus, plug it into the primary server terminal. I'll need forty minutes to execute the upload remotely. During that time, you cannot let anyone interrupt the process. If the connection breaks, the upload fails."

"Understood."

"One more thing." Rostova's expression became serious. "The override will sever your connection to Kross's control network. But Agent Six, it won't change who you're becoming. The itch will still be there. The quench will still call to you. Breaking free from Kross doesn't mean you're free from what he made you."

Jon took the data spike, slipped it into his jacket pocket. "One problem at a time."

They left Prague that night, Marko picking them up in a nondescript van and driving them west toward Germany. Rostova stayed behind, watching from her window as they disappeared into the dark.

As the city lights faded behind them, Jon felt the itch starting to build again. The alley fight had bought him maybe forty-eight hours. After that, the pressure would return.

And he'd need to feed it again.

*Six days to Nevada,* he thought. *Six days to keep it together.*

*Six days to pretend I'm still in control.*

---

The cargo ship was a rust-bucket freighter called the *Volga Star*, flying a Liberian flag and crewed by men who looked like they'd never seen a customs inspection they couldn't bribe their way past.

Jon and Mira were given a storage container below deck, fitted with bunks, a chemical toilet, and enough food and water for the Atlantic crossing. It was cramped, dark, and smelled like diesel and bilge water.

It was also off the grid. No surveillance. No tracking. For eight days, they'd be ghosts.

The ship left Hamburg on a gray, drizzling morning. As the German coast disappeared behind them, Mira pulled out her laptop and began running final checks on the infiltration plan.

Jon sat on his bunk, trying to meditate, trying to calm the itch that was already starting to whisper.

"Can I ask you something?" Mira said after a long silence.

"Sure."

"That morning in Prague. When you left the apartment. What did you really do?"

Jon hesitated. "I stopped three men from assaulting a woman."

"Did you kill them?"

"No."

"But you wanted to."

It wasn't a question.

"Yes," Jon admitted. "I wanted to. The itch was screaming for it. But I didn't. I shot one in the knee, broke another's arm, knocked the third unconscious. Then I left."

"And how did it feel?"

Jon looked at her. "Good. It felt good. Not as good as killing them would have felt, but good enough." He shook his head. "I'm turning into what Kross wanted, Mira. I can feel it happening. Every time I fight, every time I give in to the itch, the line between who I was and who I'm becoming blurs a little more."

"Then why keep fighting?"

"Because the alternative is becoming a remote-controlled weapon. At least this way, I choose my targets. I aim at people who deserve it."

"And who decides who deserves it?" Mira asked quietly. "Those men in the alley were criminals. Rapists. Murderers. Easy targets. But what happens when the line gets blurrier? When you start justifying violence against people who are just... in the way?"

Jon didn't have an answer.

They sat in silence for a long time, the ship's engines rumbling beneath them, carrying them toward a confrontation neither of them was sure they'd survive.

Finally, Mira spoke again. "Promise me something, Jon."

"What?"

"Promise me that when we get to the Nexus, when we break Kross's control protocol—promise me you'll keep fighting. Keep fighting to be the man who brought everyone home. Don't let the itch win."

Jon wanted to make that promise. Wanted to believe he could keep it.

But he remembered the quench. The euphoria. The feeling of perfect, controlled violence.

And he remembered how much he was starting to crave it.

"I'll try," he said.

It was the most honest answer he could give.

---

The Atlantic crossing took eight days.

Eight days of darkness and diesel fumes. Eight days of Mira planning and Jon trying to keep the itch at bay. Eight days of feeling the pressure build like water behind a dam.

By day six, Jon was barely sleeping. The itch had graduated from discomfort to actual pain—a burning, crawling sensation under his skin that made him want to tear his way out of his own body.

He tried everything. Ran in place for hours until his enhanced muscles screamed. Did push-ups until his arms gave out. Meditated until his mind was blank.

Nothing worked.

On day seven, Mira woke to find Jon standing in the corner of the container, his fists clenched so tight they were bleeding, his whole body shaking.

"Jon?"

"Don't," he said through clenched teeth. "Don't come near me."

"Jon, what's wrong?"

"The itch. It's... it's bad, Mira. Really bad. I can't... I need to hit something. I need to hurt something. And if you come near me right now, I might—"

He couldn't finish the sentence.

Mira stayed where she was. "Can you hold out? We dock in New York tomorrow. Marko will have ground transport waiting. We'll be in Nevada in three days."

"I don't know."

"You have to. Jon, please. I need you to hold on. Just a little longer."

Jon squeezed his eyes shut, trying to center himself, trying to find some core of control that the lattice hadn't corrupted.

*Think of Pops. Rhino. The team. You're Jon Rivian. You bring everyone home. You're not a monster. You're not—*

*You're exactly what Kross made you,* the cold voice whispered. *A weapon. And weapons don't feel guilt. They just kill.*

"I'm okay," Jon lied. "I'm okay. I can hold on."

But he could feel the dam cracking.

And when it broke, he wasn't sure there'd be anything left of Jon Rivian to put back together.

**End of Chapter 8**
