# Chapter 3: The Rebirth

Consciousness returned in fragments.

First came sensation: warmth, thick and enveloping, like being wrapped in honey. Then sound: a low, thrumming hum that resonated in his chest cavity, rhythmic and constant, almost like a heartbeat but not quite. Then touch: pressure all around him, gentle but omnipresent, as if he were floating in something denser than water but lighter than earth.

Jan tried to open his eyes.

They wouldn't respond.

Panic spiked through him—a bright, chemical terror that lit up his nervous system like a flare. He tried to move his arms, his legs, tried to thrash, to fight, to escape whatever prison held him.

Nothing. His body was a distant country, unreachable.

He tried to scream.

No air. No lungs. No throat.

The panic crescendoed into something beyond fear, a primal horror that had no name. He was trapped in his own skull, a prisoner in dead meat, aware but powerless, the worst nightmare of every soldier who'd ever seen a quadriplegic veteran staring at the ceiling with eyes that still worked.

*I'm paralyzed. The fall. Oh God, the fall broke my back and I'm paralyzed and I'm going to spend the rest of my life like this—*

"Heart rate elevated. Neural activity spiking. He's conscious." The voice was female, clinical, distant.

"Sedate him." A different voice. Male. Calm. Familiar.

"Dr. Kross, the protocol says—"

"I said sedate him. We're not ready for full emergence yet. Another forty-eight hours minimum."

A new sensation: cold, spreading through his veins like liquid nitrogen. The panic dulled, smoothed out, became something manageable. The terror was still there, but it was wrapped in cotton now, distant.

The darkness rose up again, and Jan sank into it gratefully.

---

The next time consciousness returned, it came with purpose.

"Begin emergence sequence," the male voice said. Dr. Kross. Jan remembered him now. The briefing. The GHOST-7 rig. The fall.

*The fall.*

Memory hit him like a physical blow: the ground rushing up, the asymmetric thrust, the impact. The sensation of every bone in his body shattering. The taste of blood. The darkness.

*I should be dead.*

"Draining the gel. Watch his vitals."

The warm, thick substance surrounding him began to recede. Jan felt it sliding away from his skin, leaving him cold. Air touched him—actual air—and it felt wrong, too thin, too sharp.

"Respiratory function nominal. Neural integration at 94%. Musculoskeletal repair complete. Dr. Kross, he's ready."

"Open the tank."

There was a hiss of equalizing pressure, and then light—brilliant, searing white light that stabbed through Jan's eyelids even though they were still closed. He tried to raise a hand to shield his eyes and was shocked when his hand actually moved.

*I can move.*

His eyes opened.

The light resolved into a high, vaulted ceiling studded with recessed LED panels. Medical equipment surrounded him, sleek and expensive, the kind of gear he'd only seen in classified military hospitals. He was lying in a transparent tank filled with residual amber-colored gel that was draining away through vents in the bottom.

And standing beside the tank, looking down at him with an expression of profound satisfaction, was Dr. Elias Kross.

"Welcome back, Jan," Kross said. His voice was warm, almost paternal. "How do you feel?"

Jan opened his mouth to respond. His throat was raw, his vocal cords rusty. "I... where...?"

"Take your time. You've been under for sixty-three days."

*Sixty-three days.*

Jan's mind reeled. Two months. He'd been unconscious for two months.

"The fall," Jan croaked. "I remember... I hit the ground."

"You did more than hit it. You cratered it." Kross gestured to a technician Jan couldn't see. "Show him."

A holographic display materialized in the air above the tank. It showed helmet-cam footage—his helmet cam—from the GHOST-7 test jump. Jan watched himself fall, watched the thrusters fail, watched the asymmetric ignition that sent him spinning. And then the impact.

The footage was clinical, dispassionate. It showed his body hitting the ground at a forty-seven-degree angle at 47.3 miles per hour. It showed the armored suit crumpling like tinfoil. It showed blood spraying across the impact zone in a fine mist.

The display shifted to medical scans. A skeletal X-ray showed a body that looked like it had been fed through an industrial shredder. Shattered vertebrae. Fractured skull. Ribs broken in seventeen places. Pelvis split. Both femurs snapped. Internal organs—liver, spleen, kidneys—ruptured.

"You were, in medical terms, paste," Kross said matter-of-factly. "Your brain was intact, protected by your helmet and the graphene-weave skull reinforcement in your combat suit. But everything else?" He made a dismissive gesture. "Junk. Unsalvageable by any conventional measure."

Jan stared at the scans, unable to process what he was seeing. That was his body. That wreckage was him.

"I should be dead," he whispered.

"You were dead," Kross corrected. "Clinically. Your heart stopped on the medevac. You were DOA at Womack Army Medical Center." He leaned closer, his eyes intense. "And that's when I saved you."

"How?"

Kross smiled. It was the smile of a man holding a royal flush. "Project MOSAIK. A $60 billion black research initiative funded by a consortium of defense agencies you've never heard of. We've been developing next-generation enhancement technologies for the modern battlefield. And you, Jan Rivian, just became our first successful human trial."

Jan tried to sit up. His body responded instantly, smoothly, with none of the weakness he'd expected after two months of unconsciousness. He pushed himself upright in the tank, the last of the gel sloughing off his skin.

That's when he looked down at himself.

His body was his, but also not. The muscle definition was the same—he was still lean and hard—but his skin looked different. In certain angles of light, he could see faint, geometric patterns beneath the surface, like a microscopic honeycomb lattice.

"What did you do to me?" His voice was stronger now, edged with something between anger and awe.

"I rebuilt you," Kross said. "Better than you were. Stronger. Faster. More resilient. You are the living embodiment of humanity's next evolutionary step."

A technician—a young woman in a white lab coat with the kind of exhausted eyes that spoke of too many consecutive shifts—approached with a biometric scanner. She ran it over Jan's torso, and data began populating the holographic display.

**SUBJECT: RIVIAN, JAN (CODENAME: AGENT SIX)**
**STATUS: EMERGENCE COMPLETE**
**CREEP-6 INTEGRATION: 99.7%**
**SYSTEMIC SATURATION: FULL**
**QUANTUM-NEURAL INTERFACE: ONLINE**
**AUTONOMIC REPAIR FUNCTION: ACTIVE**
**POWER DRAW: 1.7 KILOWATTS (RESTING STATE)**

"Creep-6?" Jan asked.

Kross's smile widened. "The miracle that saved your life. Let me show you."

---

The briefing room was underground, three levels below the emergence lab. Jan walked there under his own power, dressed in a simple gray jumpsuit that the technicians had given him. Every step felt strange—too easy, too smooth, like his legs were springs instead of bone and muscle.

The room was windowless, dominated by a central holographic projector. Kross stood at the controls, and Jan sat in a chair that adjusted automatically to his body shape. Two other people were present: the exhausted technician from before, whose name tag read **Dr. L. Martinez**, and a severe-looking man in a military uniform with no rank insignia or unit patches.

"Jan, this is Colonel Vance," Kross said, gesturing to the military man. "He represents the interests of our funding consortium. And you've already met Dr. Martinez. She's our lead biointegration specialist."

Martinez gave Jan a tight nod. She looked like she wanted to be anywhere else.

Vance said nothing, just watched Jan with the flat, assessing gaze of someone evaluating a weapon system.

"Let's begin," Kross said.

The holographic projector flared to life, displaying a three-dimensional model of a hexagonal lattice structure. It rotated slowly, each connection point glowing with a faint blue light.

"This is graphene," Kross said. "A single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. It's the strongest material in existence—200 times stronger than steel by weight. It's also an excellent conductor of both heat and electricity."

The image shifted, zooming in to show individual atoms. "For decades, graphene has been a miracle material looking for a practical application. We found one."

The lattice structure transformed, growing more complex. Tiny, spider-like machines appeared at the connection points, building and reinforcing the structure.

"Creep-6 is a programmable nanoscale bot," Kross continued. "Each unit is approximately 50 nanometers in diameter—smaller than most viruses. When introduced into the human body, Creep-6 bots spread systemically through the bloodstream, penetrating every organ, muscle, bone, and nerve."

Jan watched, transfixed, as the animation showed the nanobots infiltrating a human cell. They didn't destroy it. They integrated with it, weaving microscopic threads of graphene lattice through the cell membrane, the cytoplasm, the nucleus.

"Once embedded, the bots begin building interconnecting chains of graphene lattice," Kross said. "They reinforce cellular structures. They create superconducting pathways between neurons. They turn your skeleton into a composite of bone and the strongest material in existence."

The animation pulled back, showing a complete human body shot through with glowing blue lattice-work, a network of reinforcement so comprehensive it touched every cell.

"The result," Kross said, his voice dropping to something almost reverent, "is a symbiotic integration of human biology and advanced materials science. You're not a cyborg, Jan. You're still human. But you're human enhanced to a degree that was science fiction six months ago."

Jan stared at the glowing body on the display. "And this is what's inside me?"

"This is you," Kross corrected. "The Creep-6 lattice is bonded at the molecular level. It's as much a part of you as your DNA."

Dr. Martinez spoke up, her voice quiet but precise. "The lattice reinforces every major body system. Your muscular system can now generate force far beyond human norms because the graphene threading prevents muscle fiber tearing. Your skeletal system is effectively unbreakable. Your nervous system—" She hesitated.

"Tell him," Kross said.

Martinez took a breath. "Your nervous system has been enhanced with quantum-coherent graphene pathways. Your brain is now operating as a quantum-level processor. You can perform calculations and process information at speeds that were previously impossible for biological systems."

Jan looked at his hands. In the dim light of the briefing room, he could just barely see the lattice beneath his skin, a ghostly honeycomb pattern.

"The autonomic repair function is perhaps the most remarkable feature," Kross added. "Damaged tissue is identified and repaired automatically by the nanobots. Cuts seal in minutes. Broken bones in hours. The lattice itself is self-healing."

"And the power draw?" Jan asked, remembering the biometric reading. "1.7 kilowatts?"

"The Creep-6 lattice is a room-temperature superconductor," Kross explained. "It can channel and store energy with almost perfect efficiency. Your body can now draw energy from multiple sources—food, ambient electromagnetic radiation, even direct electrical current. You're a living battery."

Colonel Vance spoke for the first time. His voice was a gravelly monotone. "How durable is he?"

"Extremely," Kross said. "We've run simulations. Agent Six can survive gunfire from small arms and even some rifle calibers. Blunt force trauma that would pulverize a normal human will be absorbed and distributed across the lattice. He's resistant to extreme temperatures, radiation, chemical agents—"

"I want live tests," Vance interrupted.

Kross's smile never wavered. "Of course. That's phase two."

Jan felt a chill that had nothing to do with temperature. "You're going to shoot me?"

"We're going to test your capabilities," Kross said smoothly. "To ensure you're ready for operational deployment."

"Operational deployment?" Jan stood up, the chair scraping back. "I didn't volunteer for this. I volunteered to test a HALO rig."

"A HALO rig that failed catastrophically," Kross said, his voice still calm. "You died, Jan. Legally, officially, you are deceased. There was a funeral. Your team was there. Pops gave a eulogy."

The words hit Jan like a punch to the gut. "What?"

"You're dead," Kross repeated. "Jan Rivian, Medal of Honor candidate, beloved operator, American hero—he's buried in Arlington with full honors. But you?" He gestured at Jan. "You're something new. Something better. You're Agent Six, the sixth subject in the MOSAIK trial program and the first to achieve full integration."

"What happened to the other five?" Jan asked, his voice hollow.

Dr. Martinez looked away.

Vance said, "Irrelevant."

Kross stepped closer, his expression shifting to something that might have been sympathy if Jan didn't know better. "I understand this is difficult. But consider what you've gained. You were broken, Jan. Shattered beyond repair. I gave you a second chance. More than that—I gave you power. The power to save lives on a scale you never could have before."

*Think of all the lives I can save.*

The words echoed in Jan's mind, but they sounded different now. Hollow.

"I want to see my team," Jan said. "Rhino. Pops. I want them to know I'm alive."

"Impossible," Vance said flatly. "You're classified at a level above Top Secret. Your existence is a matter of national security."

"I don't give a damn about—"

"You're dead, Specialist Rivian," Vance said, standing. He was shorter than Jan but carried himself with the kind of authority that came from decades of making hard choices. "Grieve for the man you were. But understand that he's gone. You have a new mission now. A new purpose. Project MOSAIK didn't spend $60 billion to resurrect a soldier. We built a weapon. And you will serve."

Jan felt something flare inside him—anger, hot and bright. He took a step toward Vance.

And that's when he felt it.

The hum.

It had been there since he woke up, a low, thrumming vibration in his bones that he'd attributed to the medical equipment. But now, with his anger rising, the hum intensified. It resonated in his chest, his spine, his skull. It was coming from inside him.

The Creep-6 lattice was reacting to his emotional state.

And it felt good. It felt like power.

Kross saw the expression on Jan's face and smiled. "You feel it, don't you? That's the lattice responding to your adrenal spike. It's amplifying your body's natural response, preparing you for action. Embrace it, Jan. It's a gift."

Jan clenched his fists, fighting to control the sensation. The hum receded, slowly, reluctantly.

"What happens if I refuse?" Jan asked. "What if I just walk out of here?"

"You won't," Kross said simply.

"Why not?"

"Because you're a soldier. And soldiers follow orders." Kross gestured to the door. "Dr. Martinez will show you to your quarters. Rest. Acclimate. Tomorrow, we begin testing. And then, Jan, you're going to see just how many lives you can save."

---

The quarters were Spartan: a small room with a bed, a desk, a bathroom. No windows. A single door with a biometric lock. Jan stood in the center of the room and stared at his reflection in the bathroom mirror.

He looked the same. Same face. Same eyes. Same scar on his left shoulder.

But beneath the skin, he was a stranger.

He raised his hand, turning it slowly. In the fluorescent light, the lattice was more visible—faint hexagonal patterns shifting beneath his skin like submerged circuitry. He pressed a finger against his forearm, hard. The skin depressed slightly, but beneath it, he could feel something else. Something rigid. The reinforced lattice.

*I'm not human anymore.*

The thought came unbidden, and he immediately rejected it. No. He was still human. Still Jan Rivian. Still the man who'd pulled Pops from a collapsing building.

But Jan Rivian was dead. Buried in Arlington.

*So who am I?*

He sat on the bed. It was too soft. Everything in the room felt wrong, like a movie set designed to look like a bedroom but missing some essential quality of realness.

He thought about Rhino. About Pops. About his team standing at his graveside, believing he was gone.

He thought about Kross's words: *Think of all the lives you can save.*

And he thought about the hum. The power he'd felt when his anger spiked. The sense that his body was no longer entirely his own but something shared, something co-piloted.

There was a soft chime, and the door slid open.

Dr. Martinez stood in the threshold, holding a data tablet. She looked even more exhausted than before, dark circles under her eyes like bruises.

"Thought you might want some answers," she said quietly. "The ones Kross won't give you."

Jan stood. "Come in."

She entered, and the door hissed shut behind her. She handed him the tablet. On the screen was a file labeled **MOSAIK: SUBJECTS 1-5**.

"What is this?" Jan asked.

"The truth," Martinez said. "Kross told you that you're the first successful integration. That's technically accurate. But it's not the whole story."

Jan scrolled through the file. Five names. Five faces. All soldiers. All young. All volunteers.

**Subject One: Captain Matteo Rask. EU Defense Force. Status: CRITICAL FAILURE.**

**Subject Two: Lieutenant Sarah Chen. US Marines. Status: DECEASED.**

**Subject Three: Sergeant David Okonkwo. British SAS. Status: DECEASED.**

**Subject Four: Specialist Yuki Tanaka. Japanese Self-Defense Forces. Status: REJECTED.**

**Subject Five: Corporal Anya Volkov. Russian Spetsnaz. Status: DECEASED.**

"What happened to them?" Jan asked, his voice tight.

Martinez's eyes were haunted. "The early versions of Creep-6 weren't stable. Subject Two, Chen—the lattice integrated too aggressively. It calcified her organs. She died screaming. Subject Three, Okonkwo—rejected the lattice. His immune system attacked it. Massive necrosis. Subject Five, Volkov—the neural interface caused a cascade failure. Her brain basically fried itself."

"And Rask? Subject One?"

Martinez hesitated. "He's alive. Technically. The Creep-1 prototype he received was parasitic, not symbiotic. It integrated, but it didn't bond cleanly. His nervous system is in constant pain. He's... unstable. Violent. Kross keeps him in cryogenic suspension in the lower levels. Calls him 'Agent Zero.'"

Jan felt sick. "Why are you telling me this?"

"Because Kross is going to paint you as a miracle. His crowning achievement. And you are—the Creep-6 lattice bonded with you perfectly. But you need to understand what it cost to get here. Four people died, Jan. One more is in a nightmare he can't wake up from. And Kross sees that as acceptable losses."

"What does he want from me?"

"Everything." Martinez's voice was barely a whisper. "Project MOSAIK wasn't designed to save lives. It was designed to create a weapon that could win the Pan-Asia European War. A soldier who doesn't need supply lines, doesn't need backup, doesn't break. Kross wants to mass-produce the Creep-6 lattice, but first, he needs a proof of concept. He needs you to be successful in the field."

Jan looked at the faces on the tablet. Five soldiers who'd trusted the system. Five soldiers who'd died or worse.

"Can it be removed?" he asked. "The lattice?"

Martinez shook her head. "It's integrated at the molecular level. Removing it would mean removing you, cell by cell. You'd die within minutes."

"So I'm stuck."

"You're stuck," Martinez confirmed. "But Jan, you need to understand something. The Creep-6 lattice isn't just a physical enhancement. It's designed to optimize your body's performance at all times. And optimization, in a combat context, means one thing: lethality."

"What are you saying?"

"The lattice has subroutines. Algorithms running in the background, influencing your neurochemistry, your decision-making. It will push you toward violent solutions because violence is efficient. You'll start to feel it soon—an itch, a pressure when you're not active. It's the system trying to keep itself tuned, trying to maintain peak readiness."

Jan remembered the hum. The surge of power he'd felt when he was angry.

"How do I fight it?"

"I don't know if you can," Martinez said. "You're the first one to get this far. But if you're going to try, you need to stay aware of it. The moment you start enjoying the itch, the moment violence starts feeling good—that's when you lose yourself."

She turned to leave, then paused at the door. "For what it's worth, I'm sorry. I didn't design this to turn soldiers into monsters. I designed it to help people walk again. To cure paralysis. Kross took my work and weaponized it."

"Then help me stop him."

Martinez laughed, a bitter sound. "I can't even stop myself from working here. Kross has leverage on everyone in this facility. Cross him, and you don't just lose your job. You disappear." She looked back at him, her eyes full of regret. "You're on your own, Jan. Just... try to remember who you were. Before all this."

The door slid shut, and Jan was alone again.

He sat on the bed, holding the tablet, staring at the faces of the dead.

*Subject Six: Specialist Jan Rivian. Status: ACTIVE.*

He thought about Kross's words: *You're a weapon. And you will serve.*

He thought about Martinez's warning: *The moment violence starts feeling good—that's when you lose yourself.*

And he thought about the hum inside his bones, patient and waiting.

Tomorrow, they would test him. They would shoot him, break him, push him to his limits.

And he would endure it. Because he was still Jan "Jet" Rivian, the man who brought everyone home, the do-gooder who believed in saving lives.

But deep in his chest, where the lattice hummed its quiet song, something new was waking up.

Something that didn't want to save lives.

Something that wanted to take them.
