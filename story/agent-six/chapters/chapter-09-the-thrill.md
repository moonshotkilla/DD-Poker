# Chapter 9: The Thrill

The Nevada desert looked like the surface of Mars—endless expanses of rust-red rock and sand, broken only by the skeletal remains of abandoned mining operations and the occasional highway cutting through the emptiness like a scar.

Marko's ground contact dropped them at a truck stop forty miles outside of Tonopah at 0300 hours. The man didn't speak, didn't ask questions, just took his payment in cash and drove away, leaving Jon and Mira standing in the parking lot with their gear bags and a rented SUV that had seen better decades.

"Nevada," Mira said, looking out at the darkness beyond the truck stop's harsh fluorescent lights. "I've never been this far west."

Jon was barely listening. The itch had reached a fever pitch during the final day of travel—a screaming, clawing agony under his skin that made it hard to think, hard to focus on anything except the need to hurt something.

He'd made it this far without losing control, but it had been close. Too close.

On the last day, locked in the back of a semi-truck crossing from New York to Nevada, Jon had punched the container wall so hard he'd dented the steel. His knuckles had bled, healed, bled again as he hit it over and over, trying to release the pressure through pain instead of violence.

It hadn't worked.

Now, standing in the Nevada night with the facility less than fifty miles away, Jon felt like a bomb waiting to detonate.

"Jon?" Mira's voice was concerned. "You with me?"

"Yeah." His voice was hoarse. "I'm here."

"We should find somewhere to sleep. Get a few hours of rest before—"

"No. We move now. I can't... I can't wait anymore."

Mira studied his face in the harsh light. Whatever she saw there made her nod slowly. "Okay. Now. Let's go over the plan one more time."

---

They drove north into the desert, following increasingly rough roads until they reached the coordinates Rostova had provided. The old silver mine was thirty miles from the MOSAIK facility, hidden in a box canyon that looked like a thousand other forgotten mining sites scattered across Nevada.

The mine entrance was a gaping black mouth in the hillside, partially collapsed but still passable. Rusted equipment lay scattered around the site—ore carts, drill bits, the skeleton of an old crane.

"This is it," Mira said, checking her GPS against Rostova's map. "The geothermal survey tunnel is three hundred meters into the main shaft, branching east. From there, it runs underneath the facility for about two kilometers."

"How recent is this survey data?" Jon asked.

"Twenty years old. The tunnel could be collapsed, flooded, or blocked. We won't know until we're inside."

Jon grabbed his gear bag from the SUV. Inside was everything they'd need: climbing equipment, cutting tools, the data spike containing Rostova's override code, and a suppressed pistol with three magazines. Not much, but he wasn't planning to shoot his way through the facility.

He was planning to ghost through it.

"I'm coming with you to the tunnel entrance," Mira said. "I can set up the relay station there, give Rostova a solid connection for the upload. Once you're inside the facility, you'll be on your own."

"Good. I work better alone."

Mira gave him a look. "Jon, when you get to the Nexus, when you plug in that data spike—don't get distracted. Forty minutes. That's all Rostova needs. Can you hold the position for forty minutes?"

Jon thought about the itch, about how badly he wanted to unleash the lattice's full potential. Forty minutes of sitting still while alarms screamed and guards converged sounded like torture.

But it was necessary.

"I'll hold," he said.

They entered the mine.

---

The tunnel was a descent into hell.

The main shaft ran almost vertical, requiring climbing gear and careful navigation around rotted support beams and loose rock. Jon went first, his enhanced vision cutting through the darkness, his lattice-reinforced body making the descent trivial.

Mira followed, slower and more careful. Jon had to remind himself constantly to wait for her, to not disappear ahead at superhuman speed.

After twenty minutes of descent, they reached a horizontal passage. The air was cooler here, carrying the faint smell of minerals and old explosives.

"Three hundred meters," Mira said, checking her GPS. "Should be coming up on—there."

The geothermal survey tunnel was smaller than the main shaft, barely wide enough for a person to walk through upright. A faded sign read: **USGS SURVEY BORE 1984 - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY**.

Jon pulled out a tactical light, shone it down the tunnel. It disappeared into darkness, the beam swallowed after fifty feet.

"Two kilometers of that," Mira said. "You sure you want to do this?"

"Do I have a choice?"

"There's always a choice." She pulled out a compact satellite relay station, began setting it up. "You could walk away. Disappear. Live with the control protocol and just... stay off Kross's radar."

"For how long? Until he activates it again and turns me into a puppet?" Jon shook his head. "No. I cut this leash tonight. One way or another."

Mira finished setting up the relay. "Okay. You're live. Rostova's listening." She pulled out her own comm unit. "Testing. Rostova, do you copy?"

The response crackled through, distorted by distance and rock but audible. "I copy, Mira. Agent Six, can you hear me?"

"I hear you," Jon said.

"Good. Your heart rate is elevated. 127 beats per minute. Adrenaline levels high but manageable. How's the itch?"

"Bad."

"I know. But try to stay focused. Once you're inside the facility, you'll have plenty of targets to satisfy it. Right now, I need you thinking clearly." Rostova's voice was clinical, detached. "You have the data spike?"

Jon patted his jacket pocket. "Got it."

"Remember: forty minutes once you plug in. The upload is automatic, but it's vulnerable. If anyone interrupts the connection, if the power fails, if the server goes offline—the upload fails and we're back to square one."

"Understood."

"One more thing, Agent Six. The facility will have security measures I can't predict. Be ready for anything. Kross has had eighteen months to prepare for the possibility of a rogue asset. He won't make this easy."

"I'm counting on it," Jon said.

The itch pulsed eagerly.

---

Jon entered the tunnel alone.

The passage was claustrophobic, forcing him to move in a half-crouch. The walls were rough-hewn rock, marked with drill patterns and the occasional survey notation from engineers who'd worked here forty years ago.

His enhanced hearing picked up sounds from deeper in the tunnel—dripping water, shifting rock, the faint hum of machinery. The facility was close.

He moved fast, eating up the distance. A normal person would have needed an hour to navigate the two-kilometer tunnel. Jon made it in twelve minutes.

The tunnel ended at a concrete wall—the facility's outer foundation. Jon pulled out a compact cutting torch, began burning through the reinforced concrete. The lattice in his hands made the work easy, allowing him to grip the torch at temperatures that would have melted human flesh.

Five minutes later, he'd carved a hole large enough to squeeze through.

Beyond was a utility corridor—pipes, conduits, the mechanical guts of the facility. Jon was on Level Two, the medical and residential level. The Nexus was one level down.

He consulted the schematic Rostova had provided. The fastest route to Level Three was through a maintenance shaft two hundred meters east.

Jon moved through the corridor like a ghost, his quantum brain tracking patrol patterns from the faint sounds of footsteps and radio chatter. The facility was staffed lightly at night—maybe twenty personnel total—but they were professionals. Former military, well-trained, well-armed.

He reached the maintenance shaft without encountering anyone.

The shaft was a vertical tube with ladder rungs welded to the wall. Jon climbed down, his enhanced strength making the descent trivial, and emerged on Level Three.

The Nexus level was different from the levels above. Colder. Quieter. The walls were lined with server racks, their cooling systems creating a constant white noise. The air smelled like ozone and machine oil.

Jon pulled up the schematic. The primary server terminal was in the central control room, sixty meters ahead through a maze of equipment corridors.

He moved carefully, his senses hyperaware. This was Kross's domain, the heart of MOSAIK. If there were traps, they'd be here.

And that's when he heard them.

Footsteps. Multiple sets. Moving with tactical precision. Not the random patrol of security guards—this was a coordinated sweep.

Jon's enhanced hearing counted six targets, spreading out in a classic search pattern. And there was something else about their movement—a speed, a fluidity that was almost familiar.

*Enhanced.*

Jon felt the itch surge, not with pain but with anticipation.

*Finally. A real challenge.*

He found a position in the shadows between two server racks and waited.

---

The first Stalker came into view thirty seconds later.

Jon's enhanced vision catalogued the threat: male, mid-thirties, wearing black tactical gear that was sleeker than standard military issue. The gear had integrated sensors, probably tracking heat and motion. The man's movements were too fast, too precise to be baseline human.

Enhanced. But not Creep-6.

This was something else. Something older. Probably one of the early enhancement programs that had come before MOSAIK—genetic modifications, cybernetic implants, combat stimulants.

Dangerous, but not superhuman.

The Stalker moved past Jon's position, scanning with a handheld detector. Jon stayed perfectly still, his lattice regulating his body temperature to match the ambient air, his breathing so slow it was imperceptible.

The Stalker moved on.

Five more to go.

Jon could have avoided them. Could have ghosted through the server corridors and reached the Nexus terminal without engaging. It would have been smart. Professional.

But the itch was howling now, and beneath it, something new was rising.

Not necessity. Not self-defense.

*Anticipation.*

He wanted to fight them. Wanted to test himself against trained operators who could actually keep up. Wanted to feel the quench of a real hunt.

Jon moved from his hiding spot, following the first Stalker.

---

The Stalker never heard him coming.

Jon moved with perfect silence, his lattice-enhanced body controlling every micro-movement. He closed the distance in three seconds, came up behind the Stalker, and struck.

Not a killing blow. Something better.

His hand shot out, grabbed the Stalker's weapon—some kind of compact submachine gun—and crushed it. The weapon crumpled like aluminum foil, useless.

The Stalker spun, fast, his cybernetically-enhanced reflexes kicking in. He threw a punch that would have shattered a normal human's jaw.

Jon caught the fist in his palm. Stopped it cold.

The Stalker's eyes widened behind his tactical goggles. "What the—"

Jon smiled. "Hi."

Then he threw the Stalker through a server rack.

The impact was catastrophic. The server rack exploded in a shower of sparks and shattered electronics. Alarms began to wail. Red lights flashed.

And Jon felt *alive*.

The itch was singing now, a chorus of violent joy. This was what he'd been craving—not beating up criminals in an alley, not fighting security guards who couldn't possibly match him. This was a real fight.

The other five Stalkers converged on his position, weapons raised.

Jon didn't hide. He stepped into the center of the corridor, fully visible, and waited.

"Target acquired!" one of them shouted. "It's Agent Six!"

They opened fire.

Jon moved.

The world slowed to that beautiful, crystalline clarity where his quantum brain processed time at inhuman speeds. He could see the bullets, track their trajectories, predict their paths.

He dodged.

Not all of them—even he couldn't dodge all of them. But he could move into the gaps, could make himself a nightmare to hit. And when bullets did hit, the lattice hardened, caught them, turned his skin into armor.

Jon closed the distance to the nearest Stalker in 0.6 seconds.

This one was female, fast, her reflexes enhanced by some kind of neural implant. She tried to bring her weapon around, tried to adjust her aim.

Too slow.

Jon grabbed her by the tactical vest, lifted her off the ground, and threw her into two of her teammates. They went down in a tangle of limbs and weapons.

Three left.

These were smarter. They spread out, tried to create crossfire, used the server racks for cover.

Jon grinned.

*Finally. They're making it fun.*

He grabbed a server rack—800 pounds of steel and electronics—and ripped it from its moorings. Sparks flew. Cables tore free.

He threw the entire rack at one of the Stalkers.

The man tried to dodge. Almost made it.

The server rack clipped him, sent him spinning, and he hit the wall hard enough to crack the concrete.

Two left.

One of them was speaking rapidly into his comm: "Control, we need backup on Level Three! Agent Six is—"

Jon was on him before he could finish. He grabbed the comm unit, crushed it, then grabbed the Stalker himself and threw him down the corridor.

The final Stalker—young, maybe late twenties, his pupils dilated with combat stimulants—pulled a knife. Smart. In close quarters, against an opponent this fast, a blade made more sense than a gun.

The Stalker lunged.

Jon caught his wrist, twisted, and heard bone snap. The knife clattered to the floor.

The Stalker screamed.

Jon could have ended it there. Could have knocked him unconscious, moved on.

But the itch was in full control now, and Jon was no longer fighting it.

He was enjoying it.

He released the Stalker's broken wrist, then struck him with a precise palm strike to the solar plexus. The man's breath exploded out of him. Jon followed with a knee to the ribs—not hard enough to kill, but hard enough to break.

The Stalker collapsed, gasping.

Jon stood among the six incapacitated enhanced operators, breathing hard, his body vibrating with released energy.

And the quench hit.

This one was different from Prague. Bigger. More complete.

It started as warmth in his chest where the lattice was densest, then exploded outward like a shockwave. His muscles went liquid. His vision sharpened to impossible clarity—he could see individual dust particles floating in the emergency lighting, could count the fibers in the Stalker's tactical vest fifteen feet away.

The euphoria wasn't a wave. It was a tsunami.

His nervous system lit up in cascading pulses—pleasure centers firing in sequence like dominoes falling. First the primal reward circuits deep in his brain stem, flooding him with raw, animal satisfaction. Then higher functions: the dopamine surge that made colors seem brighter, sounds crisper. Finally the endorphins, wrapping everything in cotton and telling him that this—this violence, this domination—was *right*.

He'd won. He'd fought six enhanced operators who were supposed to be dangerous, supposed to be threats, and he'd dismantled them in less than two minutes like they were children.

And it had felt *glorious*.

Jon threw his head back and laughed—not the dark, bitter laugh from Prague, but something genuine. Almost joyful.

For fifteen perfect seconds, he felt no pain, no conflict, no guilt. Just pure, distilled satisfaction.

Then it began to fade. Not all at once, but in layers. The sharpened vision dulled. The warmth receded. The chemicals drained away, leaving behind a pleasant afterglow—a sense of accomplishment that felt earned, deserved.

He'd needed that. The five-day itch had been agony. This was the release he'd been craving.

---

"Jon? Jon, what's happening?"

Mira's voice in his earpiece sounded distant, small.

"I'm fine," Jon said, his voice tight with barely controlled euphoria. "Ran into some resistance. It's handled."

"I'm seeing massive spike in your vitals. Heart rate 156. You're hurt?"

"No. I'm..." He looked at his hands, at the Stalkers scattered around the corridor like broken dolls. "I'm better than fine."

"Jon, you need to focus. Get to the Nexus terminal. We don't have time for—"

"I said it's handled."

He cut the comm channel.

The Stalkers were stirring now, groaning, trying to get up. These weren't criminals. They weren't rapists or murderers. They were soldiers, just like he used to be. Following orders. Doing their jobs.

*They're in the way,* the cold voice whispered. *And more are coming. You heard the radio call. Backup is inbound. You should kill them now. Permanent solutions are efficient solutions.*

Jon looked at the nearest Stalker—the young one with the broken wrist and ribs. The man was trying to crawl toward his weapon, his face a mask of pain.

It would be so easy. Just step on his neck. Apply pressure. Thirty seconds and he'd never be a problem again.

*Do it. You know you want to. They attacked you. They're MOSAIK assets. Fair game.*

Jon's boot moved toward the Stalker's neck.

And stopped.

"No," Jon said aloud.

*Why not? You enjoyed the fight. Why not enjoy the kill?*

"Because I'm not that yet."

*Yet.*

Jon stepped over the Stalker, left him alive, and moved deeper into the Nexus level.

Behind him, alarms wailed and red lights flashed. He'd lost the element of surprise. Every guard in the facility knew he was here now.

But he'd held the line. He'd beaten six enhanced operators and hadn't killed any of them.

*Progress,* Jon told himself.

The lie was getting easier.

---

The Nexus control room was a cathedral of technology.

Server towers rose three stories high, their surfaces covered in blinking status lights. Cooling systems hummed. Data flowed through fiber-optic cables like blood through veins. At the center of it all was the primary terminal—a workstation surrounded by holographic displays showing the status of every MOSAIK system worldwide.

And standing in front of that terminal, waiting for him, was Colonel Vance.

"Agent Six," Vance said, his voice flat and emotionless. "You've come a long way."

Jon stopped twenty feet from the terminal. His enhanced hearing picked up movement in the corridors behind him—more guards, more Stalkers, converging on his position.

"Colonel," Jon said. "You going to try to stop me?"

"That depends. Are you going to make this difficult?"

"I'm going to upload an override code that severs my connection to Kross's control network. If you try to stop me, yes. It will be very difficult. For you."

Vance's expression didn't change. "Dr. Kross anticipated you might attempt this. He asked me to deliver a message."

"I don't want to hear—"

"He's very proud of you." Vance continued as if Jon hadn't spoken. "You've exceeded every performance metric. You're faster, stronger, and more effective than any asset we've ever produced. You're exactly what we designed you to be."

"A weapon," Jon said bitterly.

"A perfect weapon. And Dr. Kross is willing to forgive this rebellion if you stand down now. Return to active duty. Accept your purpose. Continue serving your country."

"By being a remote-controlled assassin?"

"By being a precision instrument deployed against America's enemies. The control protocol exists for operational security. Surely you understand that."

Jon laughed—a harsh, humorless sound. "I understand that Kross murdered me, rebuilt me into a monster, and wants to keep me on a leash. That's what I understand."

"Then we have a problem." Vance reached into his jacket.

Jon was moving before the gun cleared the holster. He crossed twenty feet in less than a second, grabbed Vance's wrist, and twisted. The pistol fell to the floor.

Vance didn't even flinch. "Assaulting a superior officer. That's a court-martial offense."

"I'm already dead, remember? Can't court-martial a corpse."

Jon shoved Vance aside, moved to the terminal, and pulled out the data spike.

"You plug that in," Vance said quietly, "and you become a rogue asset. Not just from MOSAIK. From every government agency that funded this project. CIA. DIA. DARPA. NSA. They'll all want you terminated. You'll spend the rest of your life running."

"Better running than crawling."

Jon plugged in the data spike.

The terminal's display changed immediately. Code began scrolling—Rostova's override program, interfacing with the Nexus architecture, searching for the control protocol subroutines buried in Jon's neural lattice profile.

**UPLOAD INITIATED**
**TIME TO COMPLETION: 38:47**

"Rostova," Jon said into his comm. "I'm plugged in. You have thirty-eight minutes."

"Confirmed. Beginning upload sequence." Her voice was tight with concentration. "Jon, I'm detecting significant security activity in your vicinity. Twenty-plus hostiles converging on your position."

"I noticed."

"Can you hold?"

Jon looked at Colonel Vance, who was standing perfectly still, watching with those flat, assessing eyes. Looked at the corridor beyond, where he could hear the Stalkers regrouping, reinforcements arriving.

The itch was purring now, satisfied by the earlier fight but ready for more. Always ready for more.

"Yeah," Jon said. "I can hold."

Vance shook his head slowly. "You really think you can fight off an entire facility?"

"I don't have to fight them off. I just have to last thirty-eight minutes."

"Thirty-seven now," Rostova's voice corrected in his ear.

The first wave of guards appeared in the corridor—six men in tactical gear, weapons raised.

"Last chance, Agent Six," Vance said. "Stand down. We can still—"

Jon picked up a server tower—a 600-pound rack of electronics—and threw it at the corridor entrance.

The guards scattered. The server tower hit the floor and exploded in a shower of sparks.

"I guess that's a no," Vance muttered.

Then he pulled a radio from his belt. "This is Colonel Vance. Authorization Omega-Seven. Deploy Agent Zero."

Jon's blood went cold.

*Agent Zero. Matteo Rask. The nightmare from Amsterdam.*

"You brought him here?" Jon asked.

"He never left. He's been in cryogenic suspension on Level Four, waiting for a situation that required his deployment." Vance's expression was grim. "You're that situation."

Deep in the facility, Jon heard a sound that made his spine go cold—a mechanical hiss, followed by a roar of agonized rage.

Agent Zero was awake.

And he was coming.

---

**UPLOAD PROGRESS: 35:12**

The facility descended into chaos.

Guards poured into the Nexus level from multiple access points. Jon moved through them like a hurricane, fast and brutal and unstoppable. He didn't kill—kept to his promise, kept to his code—but he broke bones, shattered joints, left a trail of incapacitated bodies.

The itch was singing, and Jon was lost in the rhythm of violence.

**UPLOAD PROGRESS: 30:45**

More Stalkers arrived—eight this time, better coordinated, using the server racks for cover. Jon tore through them anyway, his lattice-enhanced body operating at the peak of human and beyond-human potential.

He was faster than them. Stronger. Better.

And he was loving every second of it.

**UPLOAD PROGRESS: 25:18**

"Jon, your vitals are off the charts," Rostova's voice warned. "You need to calm down. The adrenaline spike is interfering with—"

"I'm fine," Jon growled, throwing another guard into a server rack.

"You're not fine. You're enjoying this too much. Remember the mission. Hold the position. Don't get distracted—"

A wall exploded inward.

Not from an explosion. From impact.

Agent Zero stepped through the hole, nine feet of twisted graphene armor and agonized rage.

The creature that had once been Matteo "Ghost" Rask looked worse than Jon remembered. The Creep-1 integration had progressed, corrupting more of his body. One entire arm was a mass of black graphene spikes. His face was barely recognizable as human.

But his eyes—one clouded, one glowing green—locked onto Jon with perfect clarity.

"Six..." The voice was wet, rasping, full of pain. "End... this..."

Jon didn't know if Zero was asking for help or promising death.

**UPLOAD PROGRESS: 22:34**

Zero charged.

The fight was instant, brutal, catastrophic.

Zero was stronger than Jon, his corrupted lattice giving him raw power that exceeded even Creep-6's perfect integration. He swung a massive fist, and Jon barely dodged. The blow hit a server tower, and the entire rack crumpled like paper.

Jon countered, striking at Zero's joints, trying to find weak points in the graphene armor.

There weren't any.

They crashed through the Nexus level, a battle between two superhuman weapons in a space filled with irreplaceable technology. Server racks exploded. Cooling systems ruptured. The facility's infrastructure screamed under the assault.

**UPLOAD PROGRESS: 18:52**

"Jon, the upload is destabilizing!" Rostova shouted. "You need to stay close to the terminal! The signal strength is degrading!"

But staying close to the terminal meant fighting Zero in a confined space, and Zero fought like a cornered animal—all rage and pain and desperate strength.

Jon took a hit to the ribs that would have killed a normal human. His lattice absorbed most of it, but he still felt bones crack. The pain was distant, irrelevant.

He countered with a strike to Zero's knee, trying to destabilize the larger man.

Zero roared and grabbed Jon, lifted him, and threw him across the room.

Jon hit the wall hard enough to crack concrete. He fell, rolled, came up running.

**UPLOAD PROGRESS: 15:07**

The fight was different from Amsterdam. In the alley, Zero had been hunting, trying to kill. Here, Zero was suffering. Every movement brought him agony. The Creep-1 lattice was eating him alive from the inside.

And Jon realized: Zero wasn't trying to kill him.

Zero was trying to die.

*"End this,"* Zero had said.

He wanted Jon to put him down. To end his nightmare.

Jon could do it. Could find the neural cluster at the base of Zero's skull, could strike it precisely, could shut down the corrupted lattice and finally give Matteo Rask the peace he'd been denied for eighteen months.

It would be a mercy.

The itch screamed for it. The cold voice whispered: *Do it. End his suffering. It's what he wants. It's what you want.*

**UPLOAD PROGRESS: 12:23**

Zero charged again, slower this time, his movements jerky with pain.

Jon sidestepped, positioned himself, raised his hand for the killing strike—

And stopped.

*No.*

*Why not? He's suffering. He wants to die. Killing him would be mercy.*

"Because if I kill him," Jon said aloud, "I cross a line I can't come back from."

*You've already crossed it. You're just too scared to admit it.*

**UPLOAD PROGRESS: 10:01**

Zero swung again, and this time Jon saw it clearly—the attack wasn't meant to hurt. It was a plea. Zero was giving him openings, exposing the vulnerable points in his corrupted lattice armor. The base of the skull. The neural cluster.

"Matteo!" Jon shouted. "Matteo Rask! I know you're in there!"

Zero froze. That one good eye fixed on Jon, and for just a moment, there was something human in it. Something desperate.

"You were a soldier," Jon continued. "EU Defense Force. They did this to you. Kross did this to you. But you're still in there. Still fighting."

"Kill... me..." Zero's voice was agony. "Please..."

"No. I'm going to break the control protocol. And then I'm going to find a way to help you. I promise."

**UPLOAD PROGRESS: 07:45**

Zero's massive frame shook. The pain was overwhelming, Jon could see it. But somewhere in that corrupted mind, Matteo Rask heard him.

Zero stepped back.

Lowered his arms.

Stood there, shaking, barely holding on to whatever shred of humanity remained.

"Later..." Zero whispered. "Find me... later... end it..."

Then he turned and crashed through the server racks, disappearing deeper into the facility, a nightmare retreating into darkness.

**UPLOAD PROGRESS: 05:12**

Jon stood alone among the wreckage, breathing hard, his body vibrating with adrenaline and released energy.

The quench tried to come.

He felt it starting—that familiar warmth in his chest, the first whisper of dopamine release. His lattice had detected combat, detected victory, and was preparing the reward.

But something was broken in the equation.

Instead of the tsunami from before, this was a trickle. A phantom sensation, like scratching an itch through thick fabric—the motion was there but the relief wasn't. His brain kept trying to trigger the cascade, kept reaching for that euphoric peak, but couldn't quite grasp it.

Because the fight had been incomplete. He'd won without finishing. Victory without the kill.

The warmth sputtered, flickered, died.

What remained felt worse than nothing. It was the neurological equivalent of a sneeze that wouldn't come—all the buildup, all the tension, and then... nothing. Just frustration coiled in his nervous system with nowhere to go.

Jon's hands trembled slightly. Not from fear or exhaustion, but from chemical imbalance—his lattice had primed him for a full quench and then been denied. The dopamine receptors that should have been flooded were empty and screaming. The endorphin response never triggered.

And underneath it all, the itch was already reforming. Not slowly, the way it had after Prague. Fast. Hungry. Greedy for what it had been denied.

*You should have killed him,* the cold voice whispered. *Look what mercy costs you. Pain. Always pain when you fight what you are.*

Jon gritted his teeth. Five minutes ago the itch had been a distant pressure. Now it was clawing back to life, feeding on the incomplete quench like fuel.

This was new. Terrifying.

The lattice was learning. Adapting. Teaching him that incomplete violence brought no relief—only faster, deeper hunger.

"Jon." Rostova's voice was urgent. "Five minutes. Can you hold?"

"Yeah. I'm here."

"More guards incoming. Can you—"

"I've got it."

**UPLOAD PROGRESS: 03:37**

The final wave of guards arrived—twelve men, fully armed, ready to die to protect the Nexus.

Jon met them head-on.

This time, he didn't hold back quite as much. Bones broke. Bodies flew. The corridor became a war zone.

But he didn't kill. Held to that line, even as the itch screamed for permanent solutions.

The fight was brutal, efficient. Three minutes of controlled violence. Twelve trained operators reduced to groaning casualties.

And when it was over, when Jon stood among the broken bodies, the quench came again.

But it was weaker than before.

The warmth was there, the dopamine release triggered, but it felt... diluted. Like drinking watered-down whiskey after tasting the real thing. His body went through the motions—the muscle relaxation, the sensory sharpening, the brief spike of satisfaction—but the intensity was maybe sixty percent of what he'd felt after the Stalkers.

Twelve guards should have given him more relief than six enhanced operators.

But the lattice was adapting. Raising the bar. What would have been a complete quench a week ago was now barely enough to take the edge off.

*Tolerance,* Jon realized with cold dread. *I'm building tolerance. Just like any other addiction.*

The pleasant afterglow he'd felt earlier was absent. Instead, there was just a brief pause in the itch's pressure—a momentary reprieve before it began creeping back.

**UPLOAD PROGRESS: 01:15**

Jon stood at the Nexus terminal, surrounded by unconscious guards, his body covered in sweat and blood—most of it not his own.

His hands weren't shaking anymore. The incomplete quench from Zero had been smoothed over by this second dose. But he could already feel the itch rebuilding in his chest, patient and inevitable as a tide.

The upload progress bar ticked forward.

**00:45**

**00:30**

**00:15**

And then, with a soft chime, the display changed.

**UPLOAD COMPLETE**
**CONTROL PROTOCOL SEVERED**
**AGENT SIX: AUTONOMOUS**

Jon felt it immediately—a sensation like a weight lifting from his mind. The background hum he hadn't even realized was there, the constant sense of being watched, being monitored, being controlled—

Gone.

He was free.

"It worked," Rostova's voice was triumphant. "Jon, you're off the network. Kross can't touch you anymore."

Jon pulled the data spike from the terminal, slipped it into his pocket.

He'd done it. He'd cut the leash.

But as he stood there among the broken guards and shattered equipment, feeling the itch already starting to rebuild, already whispering about the next hunt, the next fight, the next quench—

Jon realized Rostova had been right.

Breaking free from Kross didn't mean he was free.

It just meant he was alone with the monster he was becoming.

**End of Chapter 9**
