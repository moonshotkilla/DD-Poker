# Chapter 4: The Gift

Jon didn't sleep that night.

He lay on the bed in his quarters, staring at the ceiling, listening to the hum. It was constant now, a low-frequency vibration that seemed to emanate from his very bones. Not unpleasant, exactly. More like the feeling of standing near a high-voltage power line—a sense of barely contained energy looking for somewhere to go.

At 0300 hours, he gave up trying to rest. He sat up, swung his legs off the bed, and stood. His body responded with a fluid ease that felt wrong. No stiffness. No grogginess. Just instant, perfect readiness.

He walked to the bathroom and splashed water on his face. In the mirror, his reflection looked haggard—not physically, but in the eyes. There was a hollowness there, a distance.

*Jon Rivian is dead.*

The thought kept circling back, a vulture over carrion. Somewhere in Arlington National Cemetery, there was a gravestone with his name on it. His team—Rhino, Pops, the brothers who'd bled beside him—they thought he was gone.

And maybe he was.

He pressed his palm against the mirror, and in the dim light, he could see the lattice beneath his skin more clearly now. Hexagonal patterns, faint but unmistakable, like he'd been tattooed with circuit boards at the cellular level.

*What am I?*

The door chimed.

"Rivian. You're wanted in Test Range Alpha. Five minutes." It was a synthesized voice, neutral and impersonal.

Jon dressed quickly in the gray jumpsuit they'd provided. No insignia. No rank. No identity beyond what Kross had given him.

*Agent Six.*

He walked to the door. It slid open automatically, and a pair of armed guards waited in the corridor. They weren't MPs—no unit patches, no name tags. Private military contractors, probably. The kind of men who asked no questions and buried inconvenient answers.

"This way," one of them said.

They led him through a maze of corridors. The facility was massive, far larger than he'd initially realized. Every surface was sterile white or gunmetal gray. No windows. No indication of where in the world they were. For all Jon knew, he could be in Nevada or Norway or buried under a mountain in Montana.

After five minutes of walking, they reached a heavy blast door marked **TEST RANGE ALPHA: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY**.

The door cycled open with a pneumatic hiss.

Beyond was a space that looked like a cross between an aircraft hangar and a gladiatorial arena. The room was easily 200 feet long and 100 feet wide, with a vaulted ceiling studded with observation cameras and sensor arrays. One wall was reinforced concrete. Another was ballistic gel behind transparent armor plating. The floor was marked with measurement grids.

And standing in the center, waiting for him, was Dr. Elias Kross.

He wasn't alone. A dozen technicians occupied an elevated observation booth that ran the length of the room. Colonel Vance was there too, arms crossed, watching with that same flat, evaluating expression.

"Good morning, Jon," Kross said, his voice amplified by speakers. "How did you sleep?"

"I didn't," Jon said honestly.

"Excellent. The Creep-6 lattice reduces your body's need for sleep by approximately 60%. You'll find you can operate at peak efficiency on just three to four hours of rest per night." Kross gestured to the room. "Welcome to Test Range Alpha. This is where we're going to calibrate your capabilities. Think of it as a physical exam, just... more comprehensive."

"What do you want me to do?"

"We're going to run a series of tests. Strength, speed, durability, cognitive function. Each test is designed to push you to your limits so we can understand exactly what those limits are." Kross's smile was the smile of a man about to open a very expensive present. "Don't hold back, Jon. I want to see what $60 billion can do."

---

**Test One: Baseline Strength**

The first test was simple: a hydraulic press. Jon stood in front of a massive piston mounted horizontally in a steel frame. A titanium bar, six inches in diameter, protruded from the piston.

"Place your hands on the bar," a technician's voice instructed through the speakers. "We're going to apply increasing pressure. Your job is to resist. Push back. We want to measure your maximum force output."

Jon gripped the bar. The metal was cold against his palms.

The hydraulic press activated with a deep, mechanical groan.

The bar began to push against him. Jon set his feet, leaned into it, and pushed back. The pressure built—500 pounds, 1,000 pounds, 2,000 pounds. His muscles engaged, but it didn't feel like strain. It felt easy, almost effortless, like pushing against a door.

"Interesting," Kross murmured. "His muscle fibers aren't showing the expected micro-tearing. The lattice is distributing the load perfectly."

5,000 pounds.

Jon pushed harder. The hum in his bones intensified, resonating with his effort. He could feel the graphene lattice in his arms and shoulders activating, stiffening, turning his limbs into something more like carbon-fiber struts than human anatomy.

10,000 pounds.

A normal human would have been crushed. Jon felt his boots scraping backward on the floor, but he was still upright, still pushing.

15,000 pounds.

"Jon, you can stop if you need to," Kross said.

"I don't need to," Jon grunted. And he didn't. The pressure was immense, but it was manageable. More than that—it felt good. The hum was a song now, loud and triumphant in his chest.

20,000 pounds.

The hydraulic press was at maximum capacity. Jon's arms were fully extended, every muscle rigid, but he was holding. The bar wasn't moving.

And then Jon stopped resisting.

He pushed back.

The titanium bar began to bend.

"Impossible," someone said in the observation booth.

The bar bent further, deforming under the force Jon was generating. Metal groaned and creaked. And then, with a sharp crack, the bar snapped.

The hydraulic press shut down automatically. Alarms wailed. The titanium bar clattered to the floor in two pieces.

Jon stood there, breathing hard, his hands still extended. He looked at his palms. They were unmarked. No bruises. No damage.

"Twenty-three thousand pounds of force before mechanical failure of the test apparatus," Kross said, and his voice was filled with something close to awe. "Jon, you just exceeded the bite force of a Tyrannosaurus rex."

Jon looked at his hands and felt a surge of something he couldn't quite name. Pride? Power?

*Think of all the lives I can save.*

With strength like this, he could pull victims from wreckage. He could hold up collapsing structures while civilians evacuated. He could do so much good.

But beneath that thought, quiet and insidious, the hum whispered a different truth.

*Think of all the things you could break.*

---

**Test Two: Structural Integrity**

The second test involved a wall.

A ten-foot-thick section of reinforced concrete had been erected in the center of the range. It was the kind of barrier designed to withstand bunker-buster bombs.

"Hit it," Kross said simply. "Full force. Let's see what you can do."

Jon approached the wall. Up close, it looked impossibly solid, an immovable object designed to laugh at unstoppable forces.

He clenched his fist. The lattice in his hand activated—he could feel it stiffening, the graphene threads aligning, turning his fist into something harder than bone, harder than steel.

He pulled back.

And he punched the wall.

The impact was a thunderclap. The sound echoed through the massive room like a cannon shot. A web of cracks radiated from the point of impact, spreading across the concrete surface like lightning frozen in stone.

Jon pulled his fist back. His knuckles were intact. Not even abraded.

He punched again.

Chunks of concrete exploded outward. Rebar screamed as it bent and snapped. Jon punched a third time, a fourth, each impact a detonation of force.

By the tenth punch, he'd created a hole. By the twentieth, he was through.

He stood on the other side of the wall, breathing hard, his fist raised, looking at the tunnel he'd carved through solid concrete.

The observation booth was silent.

Then Kross began to clap. Slow, deliberate, echoing through the space.

"Magnificent," he said. "Do you understand what you just did, Jon? You just breached a hardened military fortification with your bare hands. No explosives. No equipment. Just you."

Jon looked at the destroyed wall, at the rubble scattered across the floor, and felt that surge again. Stronger this time. Intoxicating.

The hum was singing.

---

**Test Three: Reaction Time and Combat Efficacy**

The third test was the one Jon had been both anticipating and dreading.

Twelve armed men entered the range. They wore full tactical gear—ballistic helmets, body armor, rifles. They weren't real soldiers; Jon could tell from the way they moved. Contractors. Hired muscle. But they were competent enough.

"Live fire exercise," Kross announced. "These men have been instructed to subdue you by any means necessary. Your objective is to disarm them without causing permanent injury. We need data on your combat performance."

One of the contractors raised his rifle, sighting on Jon.

"Begin."

Time... changed.

There was no other word for it. The world didn't slow down—Jon sped up. His perception accelerated, his quantum-enhanced brain processing visual information at a rate that turned seconds into subjective minutes.

He could see the contractor's finger tightening on the trigger. Could see the micro-movements of the man's shoulder as he adjusted his aim.

Jon moved.

He crossed twenty feet before the rifle fired. The muzzle flash was a bright bloom of light, and Jon was already inside the shooter's reach. He grabbed the rifle, twisted it free with contemptuous ease, and struck the man's chest with an open palm—hard enough to knock the wind out of him, but not hard enough to break ribs.

The contractor collapsed, gasping.

Eleven to go.

The others were reacting now, swinging their weapons toward him, but they were so slow. Jon moved through them like a ghost, like smoke, his body responding to threats before his conscious mind registered them. The lattice was feeding him information—target locations, threat priorities, optimal strike points—all processed and delivered in the span of a heartbeat.

Rifle stocks torn from hands.

Helmets ripped off.

Men thrown to the ground with surgical precision.

Jon wasn't thinking anymore. He was operating on pure instinct, his body a perfectly tuned instrument of controlled violence.

1.4 seconds after the exercise began, twelve armed contractors lay groaning on the floor, their weapons scattered, and Jon stood in the center of them, utterly still, not even breathing hard.

The hum in his bones was a roar now, a choir of power and triumph.

He felt... alive. More alive than he'd ever felt. The sensation was electric, ecstatic, a full-body high that made every nerve ending sing.

"Jesus Christ," someone whispered in the observation booth.

Kross was smiling. "Neural processing speed is off the charts. Combat efficiency is 98.7%. Jon, you just disarmed a dozen armed hostiles faster than most people can blink. Do you understand what that means?"

Jon was barely listening. He was still riding the wave of sensation, the afterglow of perfect, efficient violence.

It had felt good.

Not just satisfying. Not just effective.

Good. Pleasurable. Right.

And that scared him more than anything Kross had shown him.

---

**Test Four: Cognitive Function**

They moved to a smaller testing room, this one dominated by a holographic interface and a quantum computing terminal.

"The Creep-6 lattice doesn't just enhance your physical capabilities," Kross explained. "The graphene pathways in your neural tissue have turned your brain into a quantum processor. You can perform calculations and process information at speeds that were previously impossible for biological systems."

A holographic display materialized in front of Jon, showing a complex encryption algorithm. Lines of code scrolled past at impossible speed.

"This is a 4096-bit RSA encryption key," Kross said. "It's protecting a simulated military database. Using conventional computing methods, it would take approximately 300 years to crack. I want you to solve it."

Jon stared at the code. At first, it was just noise—meaningless strings of numbers and symbols. But then something clicked. The hum in his head changed pitch, and suddenly he could see the patterns. The mathematics unfolded in his mind like origami in reverse, revealing structures and relationships that had been hidden.

His fingers moved across the holographic interface, not consciously, but guided by some part of his brain that was now faster than thought itself.

Numbers cascaded. Algorithms collapsed. The encryption key, that 4096-bit fortress of digital security, fell apart like a sandcastle in a tsunami.

Elapsed time: 4.7 seconds.

"Impossible," Dr. Martinez said from the observation booth. "That's... that's not possible. His brain shouldn't be able to process—"

"His brain isn't doing it alone," Kross interrupted. "The quantum-coherent lattice is acting as a co-processor, performing calculations in parallel with his biological neural network. He's not just thinking faster. He's thinking in fundamentally different ways."

Jon pulled back from the interface, his mind reeling. He'd just cracked military-grade encryption in less than five seconds, and he'd barely had to try. The knowledge had just... appeared. Like remembering something he'd always known.

"How do you feel?" Kross asked.

"Like I can see everything," Jon said slowly. "Like the world is just... data. And I can read it."

"Because you can," Kross said. "You're not just a soldier anymore, Jon. You're a living supercomputer wrapped in human flesh."

The thought should have been disturbing. Instead, it felt like revelation. With processing power like this, Jon could plan operations with perfect precision. He could analyze battlefield conditions in real-time. He could save lives by being smarter than any threat.

*Think of all the lives I can save.*

But the hum whispered something else.

*Think of all the systems you can break. All the networks you can infiltrate. All the secrets you can steal.*

---

**Test Five: Durability**

The final test was the one Jon had been dreading.

They brought him back to the main range and positioned him in front of a ballistic gel wall. Twenty yards away, mounted on a tripod, was a Barrett M82 anti-materiel rifle—a .50 caliber weapon designed to punch through armored vehicles.

"We need to test your resistance to kinetic trauma," Kross said, his voice clinical. "Specifically, we need to know if the Creep-6 lattice can withstand high-velocity impacts."

"You're going to shoot me," Jon said flatly.

"We're going to shoot at you," Kross corrected. "If the lattice performs as designed, you'll be fine. If it doesn't..." He shrugged. "Well, the lattice is self-healing. You'll regenerate."

"And if I don't want to do this?"

Kross's expression didn't change. "Then you're refusing a direct order, and we'll have to discuss your continued participation in this program. But I don't think you'll refuse, Jon. Because you want to know as much as I do. You want to see what you can survive."

Kross was right, and Jon hated him for it.

He wanted to know.

"Where do you want me?" Jon asked.

"Center mass. Stand still. Try not to move."

Jon walked to his mark. A technician placed a targeting laser on his chest, right over his heart. The red dot was steady, unwavering.

Twenty yards away, a contractor settled behind the Barrett rifle, his eye to the scope.

"On my mark," Kross said. "Three. Two. One. Fire."

The rifle roared.

Jon had been shot before—small arms fire, 9mm and 5.56mm rounds that his old combat armor had stopped. Those had felt like getting punched.

This was different.

The .50 caliber round hit him at 2,800 feet per second, carrying 13,000 foot-pounds of kinetic energy—enough force to turn an unprotected human torso into red mist.

Jon felt the impact as a massive, localized pressure, like someone had driven a telephone pole into his chest. He staggered back one step, then caught himself.

But he was still standing.

He looked down at his chest. There was no wound. No blood. Instead, the skin over his sternum had turned dark—almost black—and hard. The graphene lattice had activated instantly, stiffening into a molecular-level ceramic armor that had caught the bullet.

As he watched, the black patch began to fade, the lattice returning to its normal, flexible state. And embedded in his skin, visible just beneath the surface, was a flattened mushroom of copper and lead—the remnants of the .50 caliber round.

His body pushed it out.

The bullet fell to the floor with a metallic clink.

And where it had been, the skin was already knitting closed. In the span of ten seconds, there was no evidence he'd been shot at all. Just smooth, unmarked skin.

The observation booth was dead silent.

Then Kross laughed. Not a polite chuckle. A full, genuine laugh of pure joy.

"Do it again," Kross ordered. "Three-round burst. Center mass."

The Barrett roared three times in rapid succession.

Impact. Impact. Impact.

Each bullet hit with that same massive force. Jon felt them—felt the lattice harden, catch, absorb. One hit his sternum. One hit his left pectoral. One hit his right ribs.

He didn't fall. Didn't even stagger this time.

Three bullets clinked to the floor, pushed out by his regenerating tissue.

"Unbelievable," Colonel Vance muttered.

Jon looked at his chest. The skin was smooth, perfect, unblemished. He touched the spot where the first bullet had hit. No pain. No tenderness. Nothing.

He'd just been shot four times with an anti-materiel rifle, and he felt fine.

Better than fine.

He felt invincible.

The hum was a symphony now, a chorus of power that filled every cell of his body. He'd been broken, shattered, reduced to paste, and now he was something that couldn't be broken. Something that couldn't be killed.

The sensation was overwhelming, intoxicating, addictive.

Jon looked up at the observation booth, at Kross's smiling face, and understood with perfect clarity what the doctor had created.

Not a soldier.

A god.

---

After the tests, they let Jon shower in a decontamination facility adjacent to the range. He stood under scalding water, watching it sluice over his skin, over the lattice that had turned him into something more than human.

His hands were steady. His breathing was calm. But inside, his thoughts were a maelstrom.

He'd enjoyed it.

The tests, the violence, the sensation of perfect, overwhelming power—he'd enjoyed all of it.

The moment when he'd punched through solid concrete. The four seconds when he'd dismantled twelve armed men. The electric thrill when bullets had bounced off his skin.

All of it had felt good. Not just satisfying, but deeply, fundamentally pleasurable in a way that scared him.

*The lattice has subroutines. It will push you toward violent solutions because violence is efficient.*

Dr. Martinez's warning echoed in his mind.

*The moment violence starts feeling good—that's when you lose yourself.*

But maybe he didn't have to lose himself. Maybe he could control it. Maybe he could use this power, this gift, for the right reasons. He could be the hero he'd always been, just... enhanced. Better equipped to save lives.

*Think of all the lives I can save.*

The thought felt hollow now, like words repeated too many times.

He turned off the water and stood dripping in the sterile white room, staring at his reflection in the polished steel wall.

Jon "Jet" Rivian stared back, but the eyes were different now. Harder. Hungrier.

*Who are you?* he asked the reflection.

The reflection didn't answer.

But somewhere deep in his chest, where the lattice hummed its constant song, something was smiling.

---

Kross was waiting for him when he emerged, dressed in fresh gray fatigues.

"Remarkable," Kross said, falling into step beside Jon as they walked through the facility corridors. "You exceeded every projection. Do you understand what you are now, Jon? You're not just enhanced. You're evolved. You're what humanity becomes when it stops being fragile."

"What happens now?" Jon asked.

"Now? Now we prepare you for field deployment. We've proven you can perform under controlled conditions. The next phase is operational testing—real-world scenarios."

"You're sending me into combat."

"I'm giving you a mission," Kross corrected. "A chance to do what you were always meant to do. Save lives. Protect the innocent. Be the hero."

They stopped in front of Jon's quarters. The door slid open, but Jon didn't enter.

"The men I disarmed today," Jon said slowly. "In the combat test. I could have killed them. All of them. Easily."

"But you didn't," Kross pointed out. "Because you're still in control. You're still the man who pulled his teammate from a collapsing building. The Creep-6 lattice gives you power, but it doesn't change who you are."

Jon wanted to believe that.

He wanted to believe he was still the do-gooder, still the hero who brought everyone home.

But he remembered the feeling. The surge of pleasure when he'd dismantled those men. The choir of power singing in his bones.

"What was the first mission?" Jon asked. "You said I'm Agent Six. What happened to Agents One through Five?"

Kross's expression didn't change. "They served. And when they were no longer useful, they were retired."

"Retired?"

"Their contracts were terminated."

The euphemism was obvious. Jon felt something cold settle in his stomach. "You killed them."

"They died in service to their country," Kross said smoothly. "Just like you did. The difference is, you came back. And now you have a chance to make that sacrifice mean something."

He handed Jon a data tablet. On the screen was a mission briefing, marked **CLASSIFIED: EYES ONLY**.

"Your first operational assignment," Kross said. "Study it tonight. We deploy in 48 hours."

Jon took the tablet.

Kross turned to leave, then paused. "Jon, you asked me what you are. Let me answer that. You're a gift. To your country. To humanity. To the future." His eyes were bright, almost feverish. "You're Agent Six. The first true success of Project MOSAIK. And you're going to change the world."

The door slid shut, leaving Jon alone with the mission briefing and the hum in his bones.

He sat on the bed and opened the file.

**MISSION DESIGNATE: SENTINEL**
**TARGET: Dr. Mira Koval**
**CLASSIFICATION: Traitor / Enemy of the State**
**OBJECTIVE: Terminate with extreme prejudice**

Jon's blood went cold.

Dr. Mira Koval. The name meant nothing to him, but the file included a photo and a dossier. She was in her late thirties, with sharp features and intelligent eyes. A scientist. A civilian.

According to the briefing, she'd stolen classified MOSAIK research data and was planning to sell it to foreign interests. She was a threat to national security. A traitor who needed to be eliminated.

Jon's first mission wasn't a rescue.

It was an assassination.

He stared at the photo of Dr. Mira Koval and remembered Kross's words.

*You're a weapon. And you will serve.*

The hum in his chest intensified, eager, anticipating.

And Jon Rivian, who had been the best soldier his country had ever produced, who had believed with every fiber of his being that he was a hero—

Jon Rivian felt the first crack in his foundation.

And wondered if he'd ever be able to put himself back together.

**End of Chapter 4**
