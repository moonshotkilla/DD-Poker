# Chapter 2: The Fall

Three weeks later, Fort Bragg, North Carolina, felt like a different planet.

Jon stood in the Delta Force compound's medical wing, stripped to the waist, while a diagnostic scanner mapped every square inch of his torso. The machine hummed and clicked, its robotic arms moving with inhuman precision. A holographic display floated in the air between him and the attending physician, painting his skeleton in translucent blue light.

"Two cracked ribs, fully healed," the doctor said, her voice clinically detached. She was young, maybe thirty, with the kind of efficient competence that came from patching up too many operators who did stupid things in stupid places. "Microfractures in the L3 and L4 vertebrae, regenerated. Soft tissue trauma across the posterior thorax, completely resolved." She looked up from her tablet. "Your bio-enhancement package is working overtime, Specialist. Whatever they're putting in those injections, it's good stuff."

Jon said nothing. The "bio-enhancement package" was standard for all Delta operators—a cocktail of stem cells, growth factors, and synthetic hormones designed to accelerate healing and increase performance. It was the reason he could walk three weeks after being hit by a thermobaric blast wave. It was also the reason his medical file was classified at a level that made most generals uncomfortable.

The doctor dismissed the scanner with a wave. "You're cleared for active duty. Try not to get hit by any more missiles."

"I'll do my best, ma'am."

As he pulled his shirt back on, Jon caught his reflection in the room's polished steel wall. He looked the same as he always had: lean, hard, the physique of a man who treated his body like a weapon that needed constant maintenance. His face was unlined, his eyes clear. The only evidence of the Warsaw incident was a new scar on his left shoulder, a puckered line where a piece of shrapnel had been extracted.

He looked like a hero.

He felt like a fraud.

---

The disciplinary review had been a farce. Jon had sat in a sterile conference room while a panel of colonels and generals watched the helmet-cam footage of the Warsaw extraction. They watched him disobey a direct order from Aegis-Com. They watched him run into a building that was three seconds away from being vaporized. They watched him emerge with Pops on his shoulder, a modern-day Hercules dragging a man back from the underworld.

The panel had deliberated for four minutes.

The verdict: "Administrative reprimand, no impact on service record. Specialist Rivian's actions, while in violation of standing orders, resulted in the successful extraction of a critical asset and demonstrated exceptional valor consistent with the highest traditions of the United States Army."

Translation: "You're a PR goldmine, so we're not going to court-martial you. But don't do it again."

Pops had survived. He was currently recovering in Walter Reed, his femoral artery reconstructed by surgeons who worked miracles with bio-printed vessels and stem-cell scaffolding. He'd be back in the field in six months, maybe less.

Rhino had sent Jon a bottle of expensive bourbon with a note: *"To the craziest bastard I know. Next time, don't make me watch."*

Jon hadn't opened it. He didn't feel like celebrating.

---

He found Commander Eric Hale waiting for him outside the medical wing. Hale was Jon's direct superior, a grizzled Special Forces veteran with thirty years in the game and the kind of reputation that made junior officers straighten their spines. He was leaning against a concrete pillar, arms crossed, watching Jon with an expression that was equal parts respect and concern.

"Walk with me, Jet," Hale said.

They walked in silence through the compound. Fort Bragg was a small city unto itself, a sprawling complex of training facilities, barracks, and research labs. The Pan-Asia European War had transformed it from a military base into something closer to a high-tech weapons factory, churning out the most lethal operators humanity could produce.

"You know you're famous now, right?" Hale said finally.

Jon glanced at him. "Sir?"

"Warsaw. Everyone's seen the footage. The Joint Chiefs. SOCOM. Hell, I heard the President watched it during his morning briefing." Hale shook his head. "You're the poster boy for human perseverance in an age of AI warfare. The guy who defied the algorithm and saved his man. It's good optics."

"I didn't do it for optics, sir."

"I know you didn't. That's why it works." Hale stopped walking. They were standing in front of a nondescript building with no windows and a security checkpoint manned by armed guards. "That's also why you're here."

Jon frowned. "Here, sir?"

Hale handed him a data chip. "You've been selected for a special program. Experimental tech. High-risk, high-reward. They need volunteers, and your name came up."

"What kind of tech?"

"The kind I don't have clearance to discuss." Hale's expression was unreadable. "All I can tell you is that it's related to HALO operations. They're developing a new insertion system—something that'll change the game. They need experienced operators to test it."

Jon turned the data chip over in his hands. It was small, matte black, featureless. "Why me?"

"Because you're the best we have. And because after Warsaw, you've got political capital. If this program goes sideways, having your name attached gives it credibility." Hale met his eyes. "This is voluntary, Jet. You can say no. No one will think less of you."

Jon looked at the building. Somewhere inside, someone was working on technology that could save lives. That could give operators an edge in a war where humans were increasingly outmatched by machines.

*Think of all the lives I can save.*

"I'm in, sir."

Hale nodded slowly. "I figured you'd say that." He clapped Jon on the shoulder. "Briefing's in one hour. Try not to do anything stupid."

---

The briefing room was underground, three levels below the surface, encased in enough steel and concrete to survive a direct nuclear strike. Jon sat at a conference table with seven other Delta operators, all volunteers, all with service records that read like action movies.

At the head of the table stood a man who introduced himself as Dr. Elias Kross.

Kross was in his mid-forties, tall and lean, with the kind of aristocratic features that belonged in a boardroom rather than a military facility. He wore a tailored suit that probably cost more than Jon's annual salary. His eyes were sharp, intelligent, calculating. When he spoke, his voice had the smooth, confident cadence of someone who was used to being the smartest person in the room.

"Gentlemen, thank you for volunteering. What I'm about to show you is classified at the highest level. You will not discuss it outside this room. You will not mention it in any communication, written or verbal. The technology you're about to see does not officially exist."

Kross gestured, and the lights dimmed. A holographic display materialized in the center of the table, showing a three-dimensional rendering of a device that looked like a cross between a jetpack and an Iron Man suit.

"This is the GHOST-7 Insertion Rig," Kross continued. "It's a chuteless HALO system using directional plasma thrusters and AI-guided stabilization. Current HALO jumps require parachutes, which are vulnerable to detection, interception, and failure. The GHOST-7 eliminates the chute entirely. You jump from 30,000 feet, free-fall to 500 feet, and the rig brings you to a controlled landing using thrust vectoring."

One of the operators, a wiry man named Chen, raised his hand. "What's the failure rate?"

Kross smiled. "In controlled tests with weighted dummies, zero percent. But we haven't tested it with a live operator. That's where you come in."

The room went quiet.

Jon studied the hologram. The engineering was elegant, almost beautiful. If it worked, it would revolutionize insertion tactics. No more vulnerable parachutes. No more slow descents that turned operators into skeet targets. Just a fast, silent drop and a hard landing.

*Think of all the lives I can save.*

"What's the timeline?" Jon asked.

Kross turned to him, and for a moment, his eyes lingered, assessing. "First live test is scheduled for 0600 tomorrow. We'll run a series of incrementally higher jumps over the next two weeks. Start at 5,000 feet, work our way up to a full HALO altitude."

"Who's first?"

"We'll draw straws. Fair and random."

But Jon saw the way Kross looked at him when he said it. The way his expression shifted, just slightly. And he knew, with a certainty that had nothing to do with logic, that the straws weren't going to be random.

He was going to be first.

---

The next morning, Jon stood in the open door of a C-130 Hercules at 5,000 feet, wearing the GHOST-7 rig. The device was heavier than he'd expected, maybe eighty pounds, distributed across his back and shoulders. The control interface was slaved to his HUD, feeding him constant updates: altitude, velocity, thrust capacity, battery charge.

Below him, Fort Bragg looked like a toy model. The sky was cloudless, a perfect Carolina blue.

"You good, Jet?" The jumpmaster, a sergeant named Torres, was double-checking his harness for the third time.

"Good to go."

"Remember: free-fall to 500 feet. The rig's AI will take over and bring you down. You don't have to do anything. Just trust the system."

"Roger that."

Torres gave him a thumbs-up and stepped back.

Jon looked down. Five thousand feet. A training jump, barely worth mentioning. He'd done hundreds of these.

But something felt wrong. A prickling at the base of his skull. An instinct honed by years of staying alive in places where mistakes were fatal.

He ignored it.

*Think of all the lives I can save.*

"Clear to jump," Torres said.

Jon stepped into the void.

The wind hit him like a physical blow, a roaring, buffeting force that tried to tumble him. His training took over—body position stable, arms out, eyes on the altimeter. The GHOST-7 rig hummed against his back, its gyroscopes stabilizing his fall.

4,000 feet.

3,000 feet.

2,000 feet.

The ground was rushing up now, details resolving—buildings, roads, vehicles.

1,000 feet.

The rig should have activated. His HUD showed the system was armed, ready. But nothing happened.

500 feet.

*"System failure,"* a calm, synthetic voice announced in his ear. *"Thruster ignition unsuccessful. Manual override required."*

Panic spiked through him. Manual override? He'd been given zero training on manual override.

300 feet.

His hands flew across the control interface on his chest, stabbing at icons, trying to force ignition. Nothing. The thrusters were dead.

200 feet.

He could see individual blades of grass now. Could see the impact zone, a cleared field marked with orange smoke.

100 feet.

Time slowed. Not metaphorically. The world actually seemed to decelerate, his brain's final gift, flooding his system with adrenaline and granting him a few extra milliseconds to process the fact that he was about to die.

*This is it,* he thought, oddly calm. *This is how it ends. Not in combat. Not saving anyone. Just a stupid training accident.*

50 feet.

He thought of Pops. Of Rhino. Of all the men he'd brought home.

*I'm sorry.*

10 feet.

The GHOST-7 rig ignited.

Not all of it. Just the left-side thrusters. They fired at full power, creating a violent, asymmetric thrust that spun him like a top. His body was whipped horizontal, then vertical, then horizontal again.

He hit the ground at forty-seven miles per hour.

---

There was no pain at first. Just impact. A sensation of every bone in his body shattering simultaneously, as if he were a porcelain vase dropped from a great height.

His HUD exploded in a constellation of critical warnings:

**ARMOR BREACH: CATASTROPHIC**
**SPINAL DAMAGE: SEVERE**
**INTERNAL HEMORRHAGING: CRITICAL**
**BLOOD PRESSURE: FALLING**
**RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE EVAC**

He tried to breathe. Couldn't. His lungs were full of something hot and liquid.

He tried to move. Couldn't. His body was a broken puppet, strings cut.

He saw boots running toward him. Heard voices, distant and distorted, like he was underwater.

"...Jesus Christ..."

"...get a medevac now..."

"...too much damage..."

His vision was narrowing, darkness creeping in from the edges. But before it consumed him entirely, he saw one more thing:

Dr. Elias Kross, standing at the edge of the impact zone, holding a tablet. Watching. Not shocked. Not horrified.

Expectant.

And Jon understood, in the last moment before the darkness took him, that this wasn't an accident.

This was an audition.

---

The darkness was total. Not sleep. Not unconsciousness. Something deeper. An absence so complete it was almost peaceful.

But peace didn't last.

Sensation returned in fragments, disconnected and strange:

Pressure. Everywhere. Not crushing, but encompassing. Like being wrapped in warm, heavy blankets that covered every inch of his skin. No, not blankets—something thicker. Viscous. He was submerged in it, whatever it was.

Sound. A rhythmic thrumming. Mechanical. Too slow to be a heartbeat, too regular to be natural. It vibrated through the liquid around him, through his bones, a pulse that wasn't his own.

He tried to open his eyes. Couldn't. They were sealed shut, not by force but by the thick substance coating them. He tried to breathe and felt the liquid fill his lungs—but somehow, impossibly, it didn't suffocate him. His body was breathing it like air.

Panic should have come. Terror should have consumed him.

But there was something else in the liquid. Something chemical. Something that wrapped his consciousness in cotton and pulled him down before the fear could take root.

And then: a voice. Calm. Familiar. Close.

"Welcome back, Jon."

He tried to respond. Tried to move. His limbs were numb, distant, as if they belonged to someone else. He was a consciousness floating in warm darkness, tethered to a body that no longer obeyed.

"Don't fight it. You're safe. You're healing. And when you wake up, you're going to be something extraordinary."

The voice belonged to Dr. Elias Kross.

And Jon Rivian, who had been the best soldier his country had ever produced, who had saved every man he'd ever been ordered to abandon, who had believed with every fiber of his being that he was a hero—

Jon Rivian began to understand that he was something else now.

Something new.

Something owned.

The drugs in the liquid pulled him deeper. The mechanical thrumming surrounded him, became him. His sense of self began to dissolve, fragmenting into sensations without context:

Warm. Safe. Floating. Reconstructing.

The word came from somewhere beyond consciousness. *Reconstructing.* His body wasn't healing. It was being rebuilt. He could almost feel it—nanoscale machinery working at levels below perception, threading through tissue, bone, nerve.

Changing him.

Making him into whatever Kross needed him to be.

He tried to fight it. Tried to cling to who he was—Jon Rivian, Specialist, Delta Force, the man who brought everyone home.

But the darkness was patient. It wrapped around his resistance like a mother's embrace and pulled him under.

*Sleep,* it seemed to whisper. *Sleep and become.*

The thrumming grew distant. The pressure faded. Even Kross's voice dissolved into white noise.

And Jon Rivian sank into an ocean without bottom, drowning in his own transformation, while somewhere far above, machines hummed and worked and turned him into something that had never existed before.
